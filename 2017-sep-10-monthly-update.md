## Poetry imports

I “imported” (as in, moved/copied from elsewhere onto this blog) three poems,
one song, and one very short piece of absurd fiction:

- [Only One Left](https://blog.passcod.name/2009/jul/28/only-one-left)
- [Slowly](https://blog.passcod.name/2013/nov/24/slowly)
- [so many alone at night](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/aug/16/so-many-alone-at-night)
- [Up Up And Away](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/feb/08/up-up-and-away)
- [ali.vei.nth.eni.ght](https://blog.passcod.name/2015/jan/10/alive-in-the-night)

## Dawnverse

I published another snippet, but this time not from Naema. I feel like posting
more of these, but for now that’s all I have that’s not full of "TK" editing
annotations and placeholders, and that’s standalone enough that it actually
makes sense without too much context.

[In that bright land from which I come](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11809908).

The title is a derive on a lyric from “The Wayfaring Stranger”. (Johnny Cash’s
version). The “bright land” in the song is gone **to**, and represents Heaven.

## Fanfiction

As usual, only “good enough to be listed” newly-read fics are, well, listed, and
not everything I’ve read during the month. Especially recommended fics are in
**bold**.

   {33k words atow}

 - {SW} [Of marriage](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8451358). {10k words atow}

 - {SW} **[Lead Me From Fear To Love](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7394932)**.

   This is an excellent fic, if very graphic given its premise and content.
   There is little that I dislike about it: most of that is the lack of
   proofreading consistent throughout. It’s not badly written, but there’s words
   missing, awkward wording, common typos, etc. The story is well-organised into
   arcs and subarcs and side-stories, with very good blending and threading so
   while you can see the different arcs, they don’t feel disjointed at all. The
   principles that the Jedi are orienting themselves towards is also a great
   boon to me, as it is exactly the kind of thing one group in my Dawnverse is
   going for, so it’s giving me both confirmation and ideas on how to write it.
   Heartily recommend, albeit with warnings for very graphic violence and abuse.
