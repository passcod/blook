<h1 id="things-i-wish-id-known-before-starting-electronics-design"><a class="header" href="#things-i-wish-id-known-before-starting-electronics-design">Things I wish I’d known before starting electronics design</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>January 2025</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bunch of things that I wish I’d known or been told about when I was starting in the hobby
of designing and tinkering with electronics, including soldering, assembly, ordering, designing…
This came about after I had a 5-minute call which turned into a 90-minute call with someone just
starting in this, and while I’m very much a beginner hobbyist myself there’s still <strong>so much stuff</strong>
I wish I’d known, that I told that person about, and more that I didn’t because it was already
getting way too long. This page is a work in progress / living document: it will be updated with
more as I think of it, and then also as I learn more, and if more-experienced people give feedback.</p>
<h1 id="soldering"><a class="header" href="#soldering">Soldering</a></h1>
<p>There’s several ways to do soldering. The three main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>with a soldering iron</li>
<li>with hot air, either with a hot air gun or station or with a heated chamber or oven</li>
<li>with a heated table</li>
</ul>
<p>For hobbyist use you’ll want at minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="#iron">soldering iron</a></li>
<li>a <a href="#heated-tables">heated table</a></li>
<li>an <a href="#iron-cleaning">iron cleaning station</a></li>
<li>a syringe of <a href="#melting-point">low-temperature solder paste</a></li>
<li>a <a href="#flux-forms">syringe of flux</a></li>
<li>a spool of lead-free solder wire</li>
<li>ventilation and PPE</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flux"><a class="header" href="#flux">Flux</a></h2>
<p>If you’re doing soldering you need flux. If you don’t know what that is, either you’ve already been
using it and didn’t know the name, or your soldering is going to get <em>immensely easier</em> once you
read this.</p>
<p>Flux… makes soldering <em>work</em>. It’s honestly hard to explain <em>what flux does</em> without experiencing
it. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy)#Soldering">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>flux serves a threefold purpose: it removes any oxidized metal from the surfaces to be soldered,
seals out air thus preventing further oxidation, and improves the wetting characteristics of the
liquid solder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I describe it is that like some materials (like butter) are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a>, flux is <em>solderphobic</em>. It makes solder
want to stick to itself and to other metals more than it wants to stick to non-metals, including
flux itself.</p>
<p>So if you put flux around a metal joint, and then you add solder, the solder is going to “want” to
attach to the metal joint and to the pin or connector leg that you’re trying to solder, and <em>not</em> to
anything else. And when <em>de</em>soldering, if you can push flux “under” some solder, it’s going to make
that solder way easier to remove from the metal.</p>
<h3 id="solder-paste"><a class="header" href="#solder-paste">Solder paste</a></h3>
<p>Flux is also what makes solder paste and SMD soldering work. Solder paste is essentially flux with
small particles of solder suspended within it. Like you’re taking solder, crushing it into a powder,
and then you thoroughly mix that with flux, and that’s solder paste. When you heat solder paste, all
the little particles of solder clump together and to the nearest exposed metal, and avoid non-metal
areas. So you then have a blob of solder that’s situated on the pads you want to solder <em>and</em> coats
the entire surface of the pad without going over the boundaries of the pad (unless you have so much
solder it “overflows”).</p>
<h3 id="flux-forms"><a class="header" href="#flux-forms">Flux forms</a></h3>
<p>Flux comes in two common forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tin of rosin, which is pine tree sap and also used by violonists and in the medical field;</li>
<li>a syringe of liquid-at-room-temperature flux</li>
</ul>
<p>Soldering kits will typically have a tin of rosin. That has its uses, but is honestly annoying and
non-obvious; buy a syringe of flux and a <a href="#syringe-applicators">syringe applicator</a> and you’ll have
a much better time of it.</p>
<h2 id="solder"><a class="header" href="#solder">Solder</a></h2>
<p>When buying solder, you can get it in two main forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>solder paste (described above)</li>
<li>solder wire</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also two main types of solder:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaded</li>
<li>lead-free</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaded solder is easier to work with, but contains lead, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning">bad for
you</a>. Opinions vary, but mine is that given solder is
often liquid and sometimes particles of it might spill in places and stick to your hands or
something, there’s a higher risk that you’re going to be exposed to it; and given that lead-free
solder isn’t <em>that</em> hard to work with; you should use lead-free solder.</p>
<p>There’s also additives to solder:</p>
<ul>
<li>“pure” solder (in wire, bars, or giant vats of molten metal)</li>
<li>solder paste (solder powder in flux medium)</li>
<li>solder wire with flux core (solder is wrapped around a core of solid flux)</li>
<li>antioxidants, antidross, ductability improvers, etc (not typical for hobby use)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solder wire also comes in different diameters (thickness), like 1.0 mm (typical) or 0.6mm (thin) or
1.5-2.0mm (thick).</p>
<h3 id="melting-point"><a class="header" href="#melting-point">Melting point</a></h3>
<p>Solder is an alloy, and the formulation of the alloy affects its characteristics. One of those is
the melting point. This directly affects how hot you’ll do your soldering at. One thing to remember
with this value is that it’s really the “solidifying point”: if you have 180°C solder, you’ll want
to work with it at around 220-250°C, because at 180°C it will be <em>just barely</em> liquid, and not
workable at all. You want it more liquid so you can push it around and so it can flow into joints.</p>
<p>There’s a wide range of melting points that various alloys have achieved, from about 90°C all the
way up to 450°C. Most solder melts at around 180°C. You can get “low temperature” solder that
instead melts at 138°C (or around there), and therefore you can work at a lower temperature of
170-180°C.</p>
<p>Low temperature solder generally trades that off by being less flexible when solid, that is, more
brittle. So if you use a low temperature solder for a device that is subjected to vibrations or
shocks, you might find that solder joins break or fracture, where a higher temperature solder won’t
have that problem.</p>
<p>Most of the time I use 138°C solder paste and “regular” 1mm 180°C solder wire. I also have various
other solder wires and pastes.</p>
<h3 id="temperature-on-components"><a class="header" href="#temperature-on-components">Temperature on components</a></h3>
<p>Most components have an upper bound as the temperature you can store or solder them at. Generally
that’s on the order of 300°C, for a short period of time like a minute. At lower temperatures, you
can more or less safely have components at that temperature for much longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Consult the datasheet for your components. For example, look at this
<a href="https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme280-ds002.pdf">BME280</a>
pressure sensor. Near the end you’ll find “Soldering Guidelines”, which includes a table and a chart:</p>
<p><img src="bme280-soldering-guide.png" alt="soldering temperature guidelines for the BME280" /></p>
<p>This indicates that they recommend soldering at 260°C peak temperature, with a preheat between 150
and 200°C for 60 to 150 seconds. Now, these are <em>factory-grade</em> soldering instructions. For my
hobbyist use, what I take from this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can’t exceed 260°C ever</li>
<li>I shouldn’t spend a lot of time above 200°C if I can avoid it</li>
</ul>
<p>Given I typically solder at 180°C, that’s generally fine, but because this is a miniature sensor,
I’ll try to limit even that, e.g. by leaving it for last.</p>
<h2 id="heated-tables"><a class="header" href="#heated-tables">Heated tables</a></h2>
<p>When doing SMD soldering, you basically have two options: hot air or heated table. I don’t have a
lot of experience with hot air, but heated table is very easy and is my preferred soldering method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: “hotbed” or “heated bed” is typically a 3D printing term, even though it’s conceptually the
same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main decision with heated tables is the size of the table. I work with pretty small circuit
boards so I have a NZ$15 55x55mm USB-powered table which fits snuggly under my microscope. For
boards the size of a Raspberry Pi or mini-computer you’ll probably want 80x80mm or 150x150mm.</p>
<p>All tables will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature control to 10°C</li>
<li>an ON/OFF heat control</li>
<li>uniform heating of the table</li>
</ul>
<p>More dollars can get you:</p>
<ul>
<li>bigger size</li>
<li>larger temperature range</li>
<li>more precise temperature control</li>
<li>temperature presets</li>
<li>timed heating and cooldown curves</li>
<li>arms on the table to hold your board in place</li>
<li>digital control (e.g. connects to a computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with a board that’s larger than your table, you can use clamps or standoffs to hold the parts
of the board that go beyond the edges, and only heat the part you’re working on. The disadvantage of
this is that your table is going to need to dump a lot more heat to maintain temperature as you’re
massively increasing the cooling surface, and you might get temperature gradients across the board
which can be iffy for mechanical reasons.</p>
<h2 id="iron"><a class="header" href="#iron">Iron</a></h2>
<p>Even if you use a heated table for 90% of your soldering like I do, you’ll still want a soldering
iron. There’s… many soldering irons out there. The one I use is a
<a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/">Pinecil</a> which is a US$26
USB-powered iron with swappable TS-factor tips.</p>
<p>Generally, you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature control to 10°C increments or better</li>
<li>swappable tips (so you can use different sizes / shapes)</li>
<li>idle sleep (so it cuts off the heat when idle for a few minutes, which preserves the tip)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a USB-powered iron like the Pinecil, get a silicon cable instead of rubber/plastic so
you don’t accidentally melt it when soldering. In fact, get a few cables so you have spares and can
use them for other USB things while soldering (like a <a href="#heated-table">heated table</a> or
<a href="#microscope">microscope</a>).</p>
<p>You’ll also need a good power supply, like the
<a href="https://pine64.com/product-category/pinepower/">PinePower</a> or a GaN USB-PD charger or a USB-PD
power bank. I use <a href="https://www.baseus.com/products/adaman-power-bank-65w-20000mah">this Baseus 65W
battery</a> with both my Pinecil and my
heated table.</p>
<h3 id="tips"><a class="header" href="#tips">Tips</a></h3>
<p>Soldering tips come in form factors (<code>TS</code> (long) or <code>ST</code> (short), suitable for the TS100, Pinecil,
etc soldering irons) and tip types. The tip type is the size and shape it is.</p>
<p>I prefer short length tips as that feels more like a pencil (remember you can’t hold the metal bit
of the soldering iron, as that’s the hot part!).</p>
<p>Most of the time I use a ST-I tip, which is a short barrel and a conical tip shape at about a 15°
angle. For through-hole soldering work I’ll swap in a ST-K or ST-C4, which are thicker rectangular
sections with a 45° angle at the tip, so you can apply a large surface at the working interface.
Both of these are available in <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-soldering-short-tip-set-gross/">this pinecil tip
set</a>.</p>
<p><img src="./pinecil-tip-short-gross.jpg" alt="box of four tip with diagram descriptions of their shapes and size" /></p>
<p>A finer tip gives you more control and the ability to target much smaller areas, but the larger area
you can touch with your iron, the more heat you can dump into the touching metal, and so the faster
you can work.</p>
<p>I’ve bought both gross (large) and fine (small) sets of tips for the Pinecil and I very rarely if
ever use the fine set, even working with SMD components that are &lt;2mm.</p>
<h3 id="iron-cleaning"><a class="header" href="#iron-cleaning">Iron cleaning</a></h3>
<p>Keeping the tip of your iron clean is very important, as a dirty iron tip will not conduct heat as
well (and may even gunk your project). At minimum you want to do a quick clean whenever you start
and stop work, and a deeper clean once in a while. At best you’ll want to clean <em>during</em> work too.</p>
<p>A quick clean takes a few seconds:</p>
<ul>
<li>wipe the tip on a (wet but not dripping) sponge pad to remove excess solder and debris</li>
<li>rub and push the tip in a brass wool wire ball</li>
<li>tin the tip (apply a bit of solder to coat the tip)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more thorough clean is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the above steps for longer</li>
<li>using a tip cleaner powder/paste (also called a “tip tinner”)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delivery"><a class="header" href="#delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
<h3 id="syringe-tips"><a class="header" href="#syringe-tips">Syringe tips</a></h3>
<p>Syringes for flux and solder paste have a removable <em>tip</em> that gets screwed on. Tips can be entirely
made of plastic, typically in a cone that you cut to obtain the hole you want, or they can have a
long metal tube that has a specific diameter.</p>
<p>The metal ones are usually better because you always know you’re getting a set size and because the
tube is long and constant-width you can “see around” it a lot easier than you can with a cone. On
the other hand, if you allow the tip’s metal tube to heat, you can have problems where solder will
liquefy inside the tip, gunking it up.</p>
<p>Syringes will usually come with tips but buying a pack of spares in the diameter you prefer will not
cost a lot and will ensure you’re not at the mercy of whatever tip size the manufacturer included.</p>
<h3 id="syringe-applicators"><a class="header" href="#syringe-applicators">Syringe applicators</a></h3>
<p>The “push” side of the syringe can be pushed “by hand” with a direct piston, but that’s usually very
imprecise and awkward to hold in a soldering context. When I’m pushing solder out of a syringe, I’m
often trying to dispense a millimetre or less out of the solder tip, and the syringe is 15mm wide,
so that’s a <em>tiny</em> amount of pressure I need to apply. Instead, buy or make an applicator.</p>
<p>There’s two main kinds, squeeze types and screw types.</p>
<p>Squeeze syringe tools fit around the syringe and let you use a finger to squeeze an arm that’s
parallel or at a small angle to the syringe’s body to dispense some paste.</p>
<p><img src="./syringe-tool-squeeze.png" alt="squeeze type applicator" /></p>
<p>Screw type syringe tools fit the rear of the syringe and offer a “scroll wheel” which controls a
threaded rod.</p>
<p><img src="./syringe-tool-screw.png" alt="screw type applicator" /></p>
<p>I prefer screw type applicators, as they allow much finer control (I often “push” the wheel by a
millimetre or less, which results in about 10 <em>micro</em>meters of displacement for the piston) and
removing pressure is obvious and instant. Additionally, I find that I can immediately gauge how much
pressure is applied by the resistance of the wheel.</p>
<p>The screw applicator I use is 3D-printed from <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/474550">this model by
Dimmu_Ogir</a>, though I had to resize the piston end to fit
my syringes.</p>
<h2 id="microscope"><a class="header" href="#microscope">Microscope</a></h2>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/4-3-Coin-Microscope-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B0CB5GHG3L">4.3“ digital microscope with PC
connection</a>, which
is NZ$80 on Amazon, but you can find the exact same for NZ$50 on AliExpress.</p>
<p>You can find more expensive ones with better features but this one is Fine™. It’s battery-powered
(less wires in your way) with about 6 hours of work time from full, it’s quite intuitive to use, and
you can hook it up to a computer where it will present as a webcam, so you can have a much bigger
screen for it and record/take pictures without fiddling with the micro SD card… or even use it for
streaming if that’s your thing.</p>
<p>There’s two small caveats with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the built-in screen has a small but noticeable delay (about 100ms). This is less noticeable
connected to a PC, though still present, probably inherent due to the technology. Most of the time
it’s not an issue, but 100ms is right on the edge of an annoying lag when e.g. typing, so at times
it can be a minor issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the camera picks up more infrared than human eyes can. You can actually see that a little in the
screen, with faint red showing up in places that aren’t at all red to my eyes. It doesn’t pick up
enough that it would be useful for temperature measurement like an infrared camera, but it <em>is</em>
taken into account by the auto-contrast mechanism. For this reason, when the board is heated up,
you generally want to turn the built-in light <em>down</em> to get better contrast.</p>
