          <p>An avatar for me. Requirements are that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>it is square, distinguishable at Twitter sizes (about 48 pixels);</li>
            <li>an original is provided in a resolution of at least 512x512 pixels;</li>
            <li>it is G-rated. I'm not fussy with what that means, but I'm going to
              use this <em>everywhere</em>;</li>
            <li>it is in colour;</li>
            <li>you do not require my likeness or details for this.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I'm just not particularly interested in an representation of myself, but
            more in whatever you can come up with. You decide. Do anything you want.

          <p>Occasionally, on request, I'll add a broad theme, or weigh in on
            alternatives, but I try to keep my influence minimal.</p>
