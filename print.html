they want within as few parameters as I need. Generally, no detail beyond
sizing was requested, although the exact brief varied for each artist.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pronouns"><a class="header" href="#pronouns">Pronouns</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in English: I’ve long described myself as “pronoun-agnostic” (which is a
bit of an abuse of the term “agnostic”), which most people know as “any
pronouns.” While that’s still true, in practice I <em>prefer</em> <code>they/them</code> and
also respond to <code>he/him</code>. <code>She</code>/<code>xem</code>/<code>peh</code>/<code>hie</code>/<code>zir</code> etc are fine if you
want to for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in French and other gendered languages or languages with only an impersonal
neuter: in the absence of good consensus for gender-neutral language, I
prefer masculine forms. If there is a well-accepted neutral neo-pronoun I
prefer its use alongside masculine forms. E.g. <code>iel</code> in French, with <code>il</code>
as fallback, but <code>αυτός</code>/<code>αυτοί</code> in Greek rather than <code>τό</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Māori and other languages with (or with <em>only</em>) a personal neuter: that’s
easy. Use it! (For example: <code>ia</code> (Te Reo), <code>O</code> (Turkish), <code>em</code> (PNG), etc…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trademark"><a class="header" href="#trademark">Trademark</a></h1>
<p>As of August 2018, “<strong>passcod</strong>” is a trademark I own personally. An official,
registered, paid for and in the books, proper trademark.</p>
<p>This was done for several reasons, three really:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because I wanted to see if it was possible, and it was cheap enough, and
didn’t require much effort at all, so might as well try it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because very early in the year, someone approached me about the name, and I
couldn’t really tell if it was a scam or not, so I took it at face value
just in case, did a lot of reading, asked a lawyer, and told them politely
what was mine and what they could do with the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because “passcod” is my <strong>name</strong>, and that means something. But while there
are protections around my legal name simply by virtue of being mine, there
is no such thing around this name of mine. I wanted to permanently tie the
name to myself (where “permanently” is “10 years, renewable”), and have it
recognised as such by the law and the land.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought of making a little guidebook document thing that outlines what you
can do with this trademark without explicitely asking me, but all the rules are
kinda fuzzy because of it being a person-name and not a thing-name. So the deal
goes like this:</p>
<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>January 2025</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bunch of things that I wish I’d known or been told about when I was starting in the hobby
of designing and tinkering with electronics, including soldering, assembly, ordering, designing…
This came about after I had a 5-minute call which turned into a 90-minute call with someone just
starting in this, and while I’m very much a beginner hobbyist myself there’s still <strong>so much stuff</strong>
I wish I’d known, that I told that person about, and more that I didn’t because it was already
getting way too long. This page is a work in progress / living document: it will be updated with
more as I think of it, and then also as I learn more, and if more-experienced people give feedback.</p>
<h1 id="soldering"><a class="header" href="#soldering">Soldering</a></h1>
<p>There’s several ways to do soldering. The three main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>with a soldering iron</li>
<li>with hot air, either with a hot air gun or station or with a heated chamber or oven</li>
<li>with a heated table</li>
</ul>
<p>For hobbyist use you’ll want at minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#iron">soldering iron</a></li>
<li>a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#heated-tables">heated table</a></li>
<li>an <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#iron-cleaning">iron cleaning station</a></li>
<li>a syringe of <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#melting-point">low-temperature solder paste</a></li>
<li>a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#flux-forms">syringe of flux</a></li>
<li>a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#solder">spool of lead-free solder wire</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#ppe">ventilation and PPE</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flux"><a class="header" href="#flux">Flux</a></h2>
<p>If you’re doing soldering you need flux. If you don’t know what that is, either you’ve already been
using it and didn’t know the name, or your soldering is going to get <em>immensely easier</em> once you
read this.</p>
<p>Flux… makes soldering <em>work</em>. It’s honestly hard to explain <em>what flux does</em> without experiencing
it. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy)#Soldering">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>flux serves a threefold purpose: it removes any oxidized metal from the surfaces to be soldered,
seals out air thus preventing further oxidation, and improves the wetting characteristics of the
liquid solder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I describe it is that like some materials (like butter) are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a>, flux is <em>solderphobic</em>. It makes solder
want to stick to itself and to other metals more than it wants to stick to non-metals, including
flux itself.</p>
<p>So if you put flux around a metal joint, and then you add solder, the solder is going to “want” to
attach to the metal joint and to the pin or connector leg that you’re trying to solder, and <em>not</em> to
anything else. And when <em>de</em>soldering, if you can push flux “under” some solder, it’s going to make
that solder way easier to remove from the metal.</p>
<h3 id="solder-paste"><a class="header" href="#solder-paste">Solder paste</a></h3>
<p>Flux is also what makes solder paste and SMD soldering work. Solder paste is essentially flux with
small particles of solder suspended within it. Like you’re taking solder, crushing it into a powder,
and then you thoroughly mix that with flux, and that’s solder paste. When you heat solder paste, all
the little particles of solder clump together and to the nearest exposed metal, and avoid non-metal
areas. So you then have a blob of solder that’s situated on the pads you want to solder <em>and</em> coats
the entire surface of the pad without going over the boundaries of the pad (unless you have so much
solder it “overflows”).</p>
<h3 id="flux-forms"><a class="header" href="#flux-forms">Flux forms</a></h3>
<p>Flux comes in two common forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tin of rosin, which is pine tree sap and also used by violonists and in the medical field;</li>
<li>a syringe of liquid-at-room-temperature flux (this might be diluted rosin or some other compound).</li>
</ul>
<p>Soldering kits will typically have a tin of rosin. That has its uses, but is honestly annoying and
non-obvious; buy a syringe of flux and a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#syringe-applicators">syringe applicator</a> and you’ll have
a much better time of it.</p>
<h2 id="solder"><a class="header" href="#solder">Solder</a></h2>
<p>When buying solder, you can get it in two main forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>solder paste (described above)</li>
<li>solder wire</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also two main types of solder:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaded</li>
<li>lead-free</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaded solder is easier to work with, but contains lead, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning">bad for
you</a>. Opinions vary, but mine is that given solder is
often liquid and sometimes particles of it might spill in places and stick to your hands or
something, there’s a higher risk that you’re going to be exposed to it; and given that lead-free
solder isn’t <em>that</em> hard to work with; you should use lead-free solder.</p>
<p>There’s also additives to solder:</p>
<ul>
<li>“pure” solder (in wire, bars, or giant vats of molten metal)</li>
<li>solder paste (solder powder in flux medium)</li>
<li>solder wire with flux core (solder is wrapped around a core of solid flux)</li>
<li>antioxidants, antidross, ductability improvers, etc (not typical for hobby use)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solder wire also comes in different diameters (thickness), like 1.0 mm (typical) or 0.6mm (thin) or
1.5-2.0mm (thick).</p>
<h3 id="melting-point"><a class="header" href="#melting-point">Melting point</a></h3>
<p>Solder is an alloy, and the formulation of the alloy affects its characteristics. One of those is
the melting point. This directly affects how hot you’ll do your soldering at. One thing to remember
with this value is that it’s really the “solidifying point”: if you have 180°C solder, you’ll want
to work with it at around 220-250°C, because at 180°C it will be <em>just barely</em> liquid, and not
workable at all. You want it more liquid so you can push it around and so it can flow into joints.</p>
<p>There’s a wide range of melting points that various alloys have achieved, from about 90°C all the
way up to 450°C. Most solder melts at around 180°C. You can get “low temperature” solder that
instead melts at 138°C (or around there), and therefore you can work at a lower temperature of
170-180°C.</p>
<p>Low temperature solder generally trades that off by being less flexible when solid, that is, more
brittle. So if you use a low temperature solder for a device that is subjected to vibrations or
shocks, you might find that solder joins break or fracture, where a higher temperature solder won’t
have that problem.</p>
<p>Most of the time I use 138°C solder paste and “regular” 1mm 180°C solder wire. I also have various
other solder wires and pastes.</p>
<h3 id="temperature-on-components"><a class="header" href="#temperature-on-components">Temperature on components</a></h3>
<p>Most components have an upper bound as the temperature you can store or solder them at. Generally
that’s on the order of 300°C, for a short period of time like a minute. At lower temperatures, you
can more or less safely have components at that temperature for much longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Consult the datasheet for your components. For example, look at this
<a href="https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme280-ds002.pdf">BME280</a>
pressure sensor. Near the end you’ll find “Soldering Guidelines”, which includes a table and a chart:</p>
<p><img src="technical/starting-electronics/bme280-soldering-guide.png" alt="soldering temperature guidelines for the BME280" /></p>
<p>This indicates that they recommend soldering at 260°C peak temperature, with a preheat between 150
and 200°C for 60 to 150 seconds. Now, these are <em>factory-grade</em> soldering instructions. For my
hobbyist use, what I take from this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can’t exceed 260°C ever</li>
<li>I shouldn’t spend a lot of time above 200°C if I can avoid it</li>
</ul>
<p>Given I typically solder at 180°C, that’s generally fine, but because this is a miniature sensor,
I’ll try to limit even that, e.g. by leaving it for last.</p>
<h2 id="heated-tables"><a class="header" href="#heated-tables">Heated tables</a></h2>
<p>When doing SMD soldering, you basically have two options: hot air or heated table. I don’t have a
lot of experience with hot air, but heated table is very easy and is my preferred soldering method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: “hotbed” or “heated bed” is typically a 3D printing term, even though it’s conceptually the
same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main decision with heated tables is the size of the table. I work with pretty small circuit
boards so I have a NZ$15 55x55mm USB-powered table which fits snuggly under my microscope. For
boards the size of a Raspberry Pi or mini-computer you’ll probably want 80x80mm or 150x150mm.</p>
<p>All tables will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature control to 10°C</li>
<li>an ON/OFF heat control</li>
<li>uniform heating of the table</li>
</ul>
<p>More dollars can get you:</p>
<ul>
<li>bigger size</li>
<li>larger temperature range</li>
<li>more precise temperature control</li>
<li>temperature presets</li>
<li>timed heating and cooldown curves</li>
<li>arms on the table to hold your board in place</li>
<li>digital control (e.g. connects to a computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with a board that’s larger than your table, you can use clamps or standoffs to hold the parts
of the board that go beyond the edges, and only heat the part you’re working on. The disadvantage of
this is that your table is going to need to dump a lot more heat to maintain temperature as you’re
massively increasing the cooling surface, and you might get temperature gradients across the board
which can be iffy for mechanical reasons.</p>
<h2 id="iron"><a class="header" href="#iron">Iron</a></h2>
<p>Even if you use a heated table for 90% of your soldering like I do, you’ll still want a soldering
iron. There’s… many soldering irons out there. The one I use is a
<a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/">Pinecil</a> which is a US$26
USB-powered iron with swappable TS-factor tips.</p>
<p>Generally, you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature control to 10°C increments or better</li>
<li>swappable tips (so you can use different sizes / shapes)</li>
<li>idle sleep (so it cuts off the heat when idle for a few minutes, which preserves the tip)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a USB-powered iron like the Pinecil, get a silicon cable instead of rubber/plastic so
you don’t accidentally melt it when soldering. In fact, get a few cables so you have spares and can
use them for other USB things while soldering (like a <a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#heated-table">heated table</a> or
<a href="technical/starting-electronics/index.html#microscope">microscope</a>).</p>
<p>You’ll also need a good power supply, like the
<a href="https://pine64.com/product-category/pinepower/">PinePower</a> or a GaN USB-PD charger or a USB-PD
power bank. I use <a href="https://www.baseus.com/products/adaman-power-bank-65w-20000mah">this Baseus 65W
battery</a> with both my Pinecil and my
heated table.</p>
<h3 id="tips"><a class="header" href="#tips">Tips</a></h3>
<p>Soldering tips come in form factors (<code>TS</code> (long) or <code>ST</code> (short), suitable for the TS100, Pinecil,
etc soldering irons) and tip types. The tip type is the size and shape it is.</p>
<p>I prefer short length tips as that feels more like a pencil (remember you can’t hold the metal bit
of the soldering iron, as that’s the hot part!).</p>
<p>Most of the time I use a ST-I tip, which is a short barrel and a conical tip shape at about a 15°
angle. For through-hole soldering work I’ll swap in a ST-K or ST-C4, which are thicker rectangular
sections with a 45° angle at the tip, so you can apply a large surface at the working interface.
Both of these are available in <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-soldering-short-tip-set-gross/">this pinecil tip
set</a>.</p>
<p><img src="technical/starting-electronics/./pinecil-tip-short-gross.jpg" alt="box of four tip with diagram descriptions of their shapes and size" /></p>
<p>A finer tip gives you more control and the ability to target much smaller areas, but the larger area
you can touch with your iron, the more heat you can dump into the touching metal, and so the faster
you can work.</p>
<p>I’ve bought both gross (large) and fine (small) sets of tips for the Pinecil and I very rarely if
ever use the fine set, even working with SMD components that are &lt;2mm.</p>
<h3 id="iron-cleaning"><a class="header" href="#iron-cleaning">Iron cleaning</a></h3>
<p>Keeping the tip of your iron clean is very important, as a dirty iron tip will not conduct heat as
well (and may even gunk your project). At minimum you want to do a quick clean whenever you start
and stop work, and a deeper clean once in a while. At best you’ll want to clean <em>during</em> work too.</p>
<p>A quick clean takes a few seconds:</p>
<ul>
<li>rub and push the tip in a brass wool wire ball</li>
<li>tin the tip (apply a bit of solder to coat the tip)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more thorough clean is:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the brass wool wire for longer</li>
<li>using a tip cleaner powder/paste (also called a “tip tinner” or “<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B002V7QDZQ">tip
activator</a>”) before tinning</li>
<li>using a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/apex-tool-group/WPB1/1801475">polishing bar</a></li>
<li>tin the tip</li>
<li>repeat the process another time</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re ever at the point that you feel like using sandpaper, the tip is probably unsalvageable.
Being aggressive with sandpaper runs the risk of removing the iron plating and exposing the copper
core. Copper dissolves into solder, so your tip will quickly die soon after. Additionally sandpaper
grit (the bits of glass/sand that make up the abrasive surface) will contaminate your iron.</p>
<p>Despite what many tutorials say, you <a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/how-to-clean-tin-and-maintain-soldering-iron-tip/2006/2">shouldn’t use a sponge to clean your
iron</a>, as bits
of sponge will come off and contaminate your iron, and later your solder joins.</p>
<h2 id="delivery"><a class="header" href="#delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
<h3 id="syringe-tips"><a class="header" href="#syringe-tips">Syringe tips</a></h3>
<p>Syringes for flux and solder paste have a removable <em>tip</em> that gets screwed on. Tips can be entirely
made of plastic, typically in a cone that you cut to obtain the hole you want, or they can have a
long metal tube that has a specific diameter.</p>
<p>The metal ones are usually better because you always know you’re getting a set size and because the
tube is long and constant-width you can “see around” it a lot easier than you can with a cone. On
the other hand, if you allow the tip’s metal tube to heat, you can have problems where solder will
liquefy inside the tip, gunking it up.</p>
<p>Syringes will usually come with tips but buying a pack of spares in the diameter you prefer will not
cost a lot and will ensure you’re not at the mercy of whatever tip size the manufacturer included.</p>
<h3 id="syringe-applicators"><a class="header" href="#syringe-applicators">Syringe applicators</a></h3>
<p>The “push” side of the syringe can be pushed “by hand” with a direct piston, but that’s usually very
imprecise and awkward to hold in a soldering context. When I’m pushing solder out of a syringe, I’m
often trying to dispense a millimetre or less out of the solder tip, and the syringe is 15mm wide,
so that’s a <em>tiny</em> amount of pressure I need to apply. Instead, buy or make an applicator.</p>
<p>There’s two main kinds, squeeze types and screw types.</p>
<p>Squeeze syringe tools fit around the syringe and let you use a finger to squeeze an arm that’s
parallel or at a small angle to the syringe’s body to dispense some paste.</p>
<p><img src="technical/starting-electronics/./syringe-tool-squeeze.png" alt="squeeze type applicator" /></p>
<p>Screw type syringe tools fit the rear of the syringe and offer a “scroll wheel” which controls a
threaded rod.</p>
<p><img src="technical/starting-electronics/./syringe-tool-screw.png" alt="screw type applicator" /></p>
<p>I prefer screw type applicators, as they allow much finer control (I often “push” the wheel by a
millimetre or less, which results in about 10 <em>micro</em>meters of displacement for the piston) and
removing pressure is obvious and instant. Additionally, I find that I can immediately gauge how much
pressure is applied by the resistance of the wheel.</p>
<p>The screw applicator I use is 3D-printed from <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/474550">this model by
Dimmu_Ogir</a>, though I had to resize the piston end to fit
my syringes.</p>
<h2 id="microscope"><a class="header" href="#microscope">Microscope</a></h2>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/4-3-Coin-Microscope-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B0CB5GHG3L">4.3“ digital microscope with PC
connection</a>, which
is NZ$80 on Amazon, but you can find the exact same for NZ$50 on AliExpress.</p>
<p>You can find more expensive ones with better features but this one is Fine™. It’s battery-powered
(less wires in your way) with about 6 hours of work time from full, it’s quite intuitive to use, and
you can hook it up to a computer where it will present as a webcam, so you can have a much bigger
screen for it and record/take pictures without fiddling with the micro SD card… or even use it for
streaming if that’s your thing.</p>
<p>There’s two small caveats with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the built-in screen has a small but noticeable delay (about 100ms). This is less noticeable
connected to a PC, though still present, probably inherent due to the technology. Most of the time
it’s not an issue, but 100ms is right on the edge of an annoying lag when e.g. typing, so at times
it can be a minor issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the camera picks up more infrared than human eyes can. You can actually see that a little in the
screen, with faint red showing up in places that aren’t at all red to my eyes. It doesn’t pick up
enough that it would be useful for temperature measurement like an infrared camera, but it <em>is</em>
taken into account by the auto-contrast mechanism. For this reason, when the board is heated up,
you generally want to turn the built-in light <em>down</em> to get better contrast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ppe"><a class="header" href="#ppe">PPE</a></h2>
<p>You’re working with high temperatures (&gt;150°C) and corrosive materials (flux). You should use:</p>
<ul>
<li>safety glasses (buy more than one pair)</li>
<li>non-flammable clothes (no plastic/synthetics)</li>
<li>ventilation</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want:</p>
<ul>
<li>some kind of mask</li>
<li>extraction vents</li>
<li>filtered fans</li>
<li>heat-resistant gloves</li>
</ul>
<p>Ventilation is critical.</p>
<p>Some guides say to work with your head to the side of the work area, not directly above. I… find
this impractical in general, and ineffective anyway. Instead, arrange for air movement to draw fumes
away. You don’t need to keep a window open, instead run a cheap $5 USB fan from the side of your
work area pointing slightly or fully away from you, but still blowing gently across your work. That
will disperse any fumes away from your face.</p>
<p>A better solution if you can is an extractor fan: instead of dispersing fumes, pull them into the
fan, and either throw them outside with a duct, or pass them through a HEPA filter, or both.</p>
<p>As a clarification point, what you’re trying to avoid is <em>flux</em> fumes and perhaps solder suspension.
Solder itself boils at 1700°C. Just like water, small amounts will evaporate off the surface of
liquid solder, but you’ll never get massive amounts of solder vapour like you will for flux and any
impurities in the solder mixes.</p>

<p>This is mostly for my own records.</p>
<p>For work I have a Dell G7 7700 laptop. This is a gaming-type laptop with 32GB

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="caddy"><a class="header" href="#caddy">Caddy</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>July 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I encountered <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> in or before 2018. Back then, it was a breath of fresh air in the HTTP server
space, something that you could spin up very quickly and simply, had good modern defaults, and
would handle HTTPS for you. However, while quite useful for running small services for personal
use, it didn’t really seem like a strong option for production. In my professional use, I built
considerable experience, both good and bad, with both Nginx and HAProxy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-caddyfile">example.com {
  file_server /static {
    root /var/www
  }

  reverse_proxy localhost:8001
}
</code></pre>
<p>Fast-forward to this month, where I encounter Caddy again while researching solutions for two
separate, different situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a reverse proxy and static file server for a single non-production application that could
handle provisioning and using <strong><a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> certificates</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a reverse proxy for multiple applications <strong>on Windows</strong> with support for updating the
configuration without a restart, without the use of signals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At first blush, Caddy was now a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, I could have used the continuing support for the Caddyfile format. But the
reconfiguration API only supports the new JSON schema. I wanted to evaluate that, see how viable
Caddy is for my production purposes.</p>
<p>So, there seems to be three main ways to use Caddy now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>With a static configuration file, reloading via tool.</p>
<p>Caddy is started like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ caddy run --config /path/to/caddy.json
</code></pre>
<p>Reloading happens with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ caddy reload --config /path/to/caddy.json
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a dynamic configuration file saved to disk, reconfiguring via API.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ caddy run --resume /path/to/caddy.json
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>With an ephemeral configuration in memory modifiable via API, initially loading from either no
or a static configuration file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ caddy run --config /path/to/static.json
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The syntax is also a bit more verbose. Here’s what I went with for an initial file server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "logging": {
    "logs": {
      "default": {

<p>Credit where it’s due, this still provisions an appropriate TLS certificate and the logs are
automatically rotated with a reasonable policy.</p>
<p>However, it took me quite a while to figure out that I needed to specify the <code>listener_wrappers</code> or
the HTTP→HTTPS redirect wouldn’t work, that specifying only an address in the listener like <code>::1</code>
wouldn’t work and that I’d need to give both ports, and how the matchers work when more than one is
in play. Additionally, configuration errors output typical Go marshal fare:</p>
<pre><code>json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type caddyhttp.MatchHost
</code></pre>
<p>(No line numbers, that would be too easy.)</p>
<p>Here’s the config I arrived at for my first task, with a Tailscale certificate serving a Gunicorn

<p>So, do I like it?</p>
<p>Well, as much as the configuration is very verbose, I do like that it is in good old regular JSON
instead of some custom configuration format that nobody implements a decent serializer for. Writing
templates in Jinja or Consul-Template for Nginx or HAProxy is exceedingly brittle.</p>
<p>The decision to completely eschew signals for configuration reloading in favour of an API is
interesting, too. It certainly makes it a lot easier to use on Windows, where signals are less of a
thing, to say the least. I’m also curious about authentication possibilities there.</p>
<p>My interest is piqued. There’s some rough edges to be mindful of, but I’m going to keep looking
into it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 June 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve just gotten a Starlink satellite internet connection as a temporary stopgap until I get fibre wire in.</p>
<p>My previous ISP didn’t provide native IPv6, so I long played with various tunnels, to various effect;
Netflix for example is very much not happy if your IPv4 appears to be in New Zealand but your IPv6 comes out in Sydney.
Most recently I was with Route48, which provided an Auckland-based Wireguard tunnel, which was pretty good, but they shut down over spam.
Thus, with Starlink having IPv6, I immediately wanted to get it going.</p>
<p>Some starlink setup details:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a rectangular dishy</li>
<li>I’m not bypassing the router</li>
<li>I’m wired in with the official ethernet adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Some mikrotik setup details:</p>
<ul>
<li>RouterOS 7.8 everywhere. I’ll upgrade to 7.9 soon but not today.</li>
<li>I have a hEX PoE at the “comms centre” of my house, which has the Starlink intake on its <code>ether1</code> (PoE in, via a 57V AC/DC adapter)</li>
<li>That powers two wifi APs in the form of two ac²s at either end of the house</li>
<li>…I’ve promised myself that I’ll get ax²s when fibre arrives, so I can have proper Wifi 6
<ul>
<li>(I did have Wifi 6 via an OpenWRT’d Ubiquiti Unify but it was still too dodgy/unconfigurable for my tastes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some network details:</p>
<ul>
<li>An IPv4 /23 in the 10/8 block, with the upper /24 for DHCP and the lower for statics</li>
<li>The hEX acts as router with dhcp/dns/ntp. I don’t do queueing so the mips is plenty for that.</li>
<li>Double NAT for IPv4, because I don’t want starlink to be able to see my network.</li>
<li>DNS “terminated” at the hEX with DoH for the upstream, again because I don’t want my DNS to be snoopable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AP setup is uninteresting save that on the topic of IPv6, I didn’t do anything special but cleared the firewall.</p>
<p>Now, the router setup. Credit where credit is due, I cribbed a bunch of it from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/xv2p04/starlink_ipv6_config_for_mikrotik_routers/">tim4324 on r/starlink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/xv2p04/comment/iz8htnl/">gmanual on that same thread</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>July 2022</p>

<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been working and helping with <a href="https://github.com/ryankurte/cargo-binstall">cargo-binstall</a> a lot recently. We’re
currently discussing <a href="https://github.com/ryankurte/cargo-binstall/issues/246">how to support WASI applications</a>.</p>
<p>As part of this, one idea for detecting if the host (your computer) supports running WASI programs was to make a small
WASI program, embed it in cargo-binstall, and then we can try running it: if it works, WASI runs on your machine, if
there are any errors, we’ll call that a no.</p>
<p>(This means that so far the only way to pass the test is to have an OS which can run WASI programs directly. On Linux,
you can configure that! using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc">binfmt_misc</a>. The hope is that other OSes
will eventually get native WASI support, or something like that Linux capability. We discussed having cargo-binstall
handle making a wrapper that calls a WASI runtime, but haven’t yet decided if that’s something we want to do. This is
very fresh! We’re in the middle of it. Join the discussion on the ticket if you have ideas/desires/commentary! 😸)</p>
<p>So: we need to make a small WASI program. Small enough that we can embed it without suffering. Cargo-binstall has
recently had a big push towards both fast compile times and small binary size, and we don’t want to undo that.</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello, World!</a></h2>
<p>First idea: start from a <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/cargo-wasi/hello-world.html">Rust WASI Hello World</a> and
optimise from there.</p>
<p>That tutorial goes to install cargo-wasi, but I thought, hmm, I think we can do simpler.</p>

<p>Gah! Two whole megabytes?!</p>

<h2 id="start-from-a-smaller-base"><a class="header" href="#start-from-a-smaller-base">Start from a smaller base</a></h2>
<p>How about we get rid of the standard library? That would help, right? Let’s google for

<p>It’s definitely in there too. I guess that makes sense, given the first error went away. What about <code>exit</code>?</p>

<h2 id="or-does-it"><a class="header" href="#or-does-it">Or does it?</a></h2>
<p>Actually, with a bit of squinting, the wasmtime error makes sense! In that <code>wasi-nope.wast</code> program, we “import”
<code>env::exit</code>. And what wasmtime is saying it “nope, I don’t have that available.” But in the <code>wasi-goes.wast</code> program,
we import something else:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wast">(import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "proc_exit"
  (func $__imported_wasi_snapshot_preview1_proc_exit

<h2 id="do-we-even-need-them"><a class="header" href="#do-we-even-need-them">Do we even need them?</a></h2>
<p>Before we get too far, since we have a small program that fits in one screenful in WAST, and we can assemble WAST into
WASM, we can do some quick and dirty experimentation.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so, what does this mean?</p>
<p>Well, in Rust you can wildcard import names into your scope:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::sync::atomic::*;

let a = AtomicU8::new(0);
a.store(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And sometimes different things have the same name:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::cmp::*;

assert_eq!(
    max(1, 2).cmp(&amp;3),
    Ordering::Less
);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>So if you try to wildcard import names where there’s an overlap…</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused_imports)]
</span>use std::sync::atomic::*;
use std::cmp::*;
<span class="boring">fn main () {}</span></code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc wild.rs

[Exit: 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Oh, right, you have to actually use something that’s ambiguous:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused_imports)]
</span>use std::sync::atomic::*;
use std::cmp::*;

<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>dbg!(Ordering::Relaxed);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>And now you get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc wild.rs

error[E0659]: `Ordering` is ambiguous (glob import vs glob import in the same module)
 --&gt; wild.rs:7:8
  |
7 |   dbg!(Ordering::Relaxed);
  |        ^^^^^^^^ ambiguous name
  |
note: `Ordering` could refer to the enum imported here
 --&gt; wild.rs:3:5
  |
3 | use std::sync::atomic::*;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = help: consider adding an explicit import of `Ordering` to disambiguate
note: `Ordering` could also refer to the enum imported here
 --&gt; wild.rs:4:5
  |
4 | use std::cmp::*;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^
  = help: consider adding an explicit import of `Ordering` to disambiguate

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0659`.

[Exit: 1]
</code></pre>
<p>So, if you were to try to make integers be an external crate that you wildcard-imported into the
scope, which could potentially look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use ints::u8::*;
<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>assert_eq!(1 + 2, 3);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>That would work, but as soon as you try to use multiple integer widths:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use ints::u8::*;
use ints::u16::*;
<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>assert_eq!(1 + 2, 3);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>You’d run into issues, because both <code>ints::u8</code> and <code>ints::u16</code> contain 1, 2, 3…</p>
<p>Also, currently integer primives in Rust would totally clash:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use u2::*;
enum u2 { 0, 1, 2, 3 }
<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>assert_eq!(0, 0);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc nothing-suspicious-here.rs

[Exit: 1]
</code></pre>
<p>Right, it doesn’t even let us out of the gate, because identifiers cannot be digits.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe we can add an innocent-looking suffix there to bypass that silly restriction?</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use u2::*;
enum u2 { 0_u2, 1_u2, 2_u2, 3_u2 }
<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>assert_eq!(0_u2, 0_u2);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>

  |           ^^^^ expected identifier

error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Denied.</p>
<p>Looks like we can’t do it.</p>
<hr />
<p>But what if we wanted to look as if we’d side-stepped the issue and made crated integers work?</p>
<p>Well, first we need to figure out this identifier thing. Who even decides what identifiers can look
like?!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/identifiers.html">Rust Reference</a> does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An identifier is any nonempty Unicode string of the following form:</p>
<p>Either</p>
<ul>
<li>The first character has property <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B%3AXID_Start%3A%5D&amp;abb=on&amp;g=&amp;i="><code>XID_start</code></a>.</li>
<li>The remaining characters have property <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B%3AXID_Continue%3A%5D&amp;abb=on&amp;g=&amp;i="><code>XID_continue</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright. So there’s a restricted set of Unicode characters that can <em>start</em> an identifier, and
numbers aren’t in that set. But can we find something discreet enough that <em>is</em> <code>XID_Start</code>?</p>
<p>Why yes. Yes we can:</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=FFA0">Halfwidth Hangul Filler</a>.
This character is <code>XID_Start</code>, and (provided you have Hangul fonts) renders as…  either a blank
space, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
enum Foo { ﾠBar }

<span class="boring">fn main () {
</span>println!("{:?}", format!("{:?}", Foo::ﾠBar));

</code></pre>
<p>Right, first, we can’t have Rust ruin the game so quickly, so we want to suppress that pesky warning
about uncommon codepoints which points directly at our deception:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![allow(uncommon_codepoints)]

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Foo { ﾠBar }

<span class="boring">fn main () {

[Exit: 0]

$ ./notacrime
"ﾠBar"
[239, 190, 160, 66, 97, 114]

[Exit: 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>So, we’re printing the Debug representation of that <code>Bar</code> variant which starts with the Hangul
character we found, and the debug representation of the slice of bytes which underly that string.</p>
<p>The bytes, in hex, are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[EF, BE, A0, 42, 61, 72]
</code></pre>
<p>0x42 0x61 0x72 are Unicode for <code>B</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>r</code>, so our Hangul character must be 0xEF 0xBE 0xA0!</p>
<p>Indeed, that’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Encoding">UTF-8 representation</a> of
<a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=FFA0">0xFFA0</a>.</p>

transparent. Let’s try this again:</p>

<p>…what?</p>
<p>Right, I’ve skipped a few things.</p>
<p>So, it may be technically possible to define addition without making any reference to Rust’s core
integer types. But that seems <em>very</em> out of scope for an article which is already pretty long.
Instead, we’re going to implement arithmetic by converting our custom enum integers to their
corresponding native ints, do maths, and then go back.</p>
<p>How do we convert?</p>
<p>Well, going from our type to a primitive is pretty simple:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">println!("#![allow(uncommon_codepoints)]\n\n");

</span><span class="boring">println!("

    fn from(n: U8) -&gt; Self {{
        n as _
    }}
}}");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Going back, however, requires a few more pieces:</p>

</span><span class="boring">println!("#![allow(uncommon_codepoints)]\n\n");

    }}
}}");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>UNSAFE?!?!?</p>
<p>Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Say we have an enum with four variants. We can safely convert it to a number, because the compiler
knows statically which variant corresponds to which number. However, we can’t safely go the other
way all the time, because what if we try to convert 32 into that enum? There’s no 33rd variant, so
the program may crash, or worse.</p>
<p>In our case, though, we know that there are exactly 256 variants, as many values as there are in an
<code>u8</code>, so we can assure the compiler that yes, we know what we’re about, please transmute.</p>
<p>And we tell the compiler that the enum must fit in and have the same layout as a <code>u8</code> with the
<code>repr</code> annotation, which lets us have peace of mind while transmuting, that an optimisation isn’t
going to come along and mess up our assumptions.</p>
<p>Now that we can go back and forth between <code>U8</code> and <code>u8</code>, we can get back to implementing addition:</p>

<p>Alright, so we’ve got maths on a single, non-primitive, enum-based integer type. Can we add another
type and sidestep the ambiguity issue?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 March 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been dabbling with Wasm for several years, but only really started going
at it in the past month, and for the purposes of this post, for the past two
weeks. I had <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1236558663269208066">a bad idea</a> and I’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1237983212212760577">working</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1238371837442002944">make</a> it <a href="https://github.com/passcod/slicism">real</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not coming from the JS-and-Wasm perspective. Some of the things here might
be relevant, but here I’m mostly talking from the point of view of writing a
Wasm-engine-powered integration, not writing Wasm for the web and not
particularly writing Wasm at all even.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I work (as a preference) primarily in Rust, and I
work (for money) primarily in PHP, JS, Ruby, Linux, etc. Currently I’m in the
telecommunication industry in New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-text-and-bytecode-format"><a class="header" href="#the-wasm-text-and-bytecode-format">The wasm text and bytecode format</a></h2>
<p>One very interesting thing that I like about wasm is that the text format, and
to a certain extent the bytecode, is an s-expression. Instructions are the
usual stack machine as seen e.g. in assembly. But the structure is all
s-expressions. Perhaps that’s surprising and interesting to me because I’m not
intimately familiar with other binary library and executable formats…
<a href="https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2020/whats-in-a-linux-executable/">fasterthanlime’s ELF exploration is still on my to-read list</a>.</p>
<p>The standard wasm tools come with <code>wat2wasm</code> and <code>wasm2wat</code>, which translate
between the bytecode (wasm) and text (wat) formats. <code>wat2wasm</code> will produce
simple yet nice errors if you write wrong wat.</p>
<p>My <em>preferred</em> way of writing small wasm programs is to write the wat directly
instead of using a language on top. I am fairly comfortable with stack
languages (I have a lingering fondness for <code>dc</code>) and a lot of the work involves
more interacting with wasm structure than it does the behaviour of a module. To
write larger programs, especially those dealing with allocations, I use Rust
with <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc"><code>wee_alloc</code></a>, optionally in <code>no_std</code> mode. I do not use wasm rust
frameworks such as wasm-pack or wasm-bindgen.</p>
<p>I have tried <a href="https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript">AssemblyScript</a>, I am not interested in C and family, and that’s
pretty much the extent of my options as much of everything else either embeds
an entire runtime or is too high level or is too eldritch, <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2020/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride/">wildly
annoying</a>, or unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Even more useful is wat’s ability to write stack instructions in
s-expressions… or not, as the need may be. For example, this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wat">i32.const 31
call $addOne
i32.const 8
i32.mul
</code></pre>
<p>Can equally (and more clearly) be written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wat">(i32.mul
   (call $addOne
      (i32.const 31))
   (i32.const 8))
</code></pre>
<p>Strictly more verbose, but helpful where following along with a stack notation
can be confusing.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-module-system"><a class="header" href="#the-wasm-module-system">The wasm module system</a></h2>
<p>There is an assymmetry in the module system that… makes sense to anyone who’s
used language-level module systems but might not be immediately obvious when
approaching this in the context of dynamic libraries.</p>
<p>There are four types of exports and imports: functions (bread and butter),
globals (i.e. constants and statics, but see later), memories (generally only
one), tables (for dispatch and the like, which I don’t much deal with).</p>
<p>While engines do support all types, as per spec, languages targetting Wasm
often only support <em>functions</em> well. It’s not uncommon to initially start with
an integration that expects an exported global, only to then change it to a
function that’s read on init and documented to need a constant output, because
some desired language doesn’t support making wasm globals.</p>
<p>Wasm has the potential concept of <em>multiple</em> linear memories, and of exportable
and importable memories. Currently, the spec only supports one memory, which
can either be defined in the module or imported (defined elsewhere, including
some other module). In theory and/or experiments, most languages also only
support a single memory, or only support additional memories as addressable
blobs of data. C &amp;co, with manual memory management, can in theory allocate
anywhere, and so may be better off… Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/alloc/trait.AllocRef.html">AllocRef</a> nightly feature shows
promise to be able to specify the allocator for some data, and therefore be
able to configure multiple allocators each targeted at a different memory.
However, that will require multiple memory support at the (spec and then)
language level in the first place. For now, designing integrations to handle
more than one memories is not required but a good future-proofing step.</p>
<p>Exports are straightforward: each export has a name and maps to some entry in
the module’s index spaces. Once you compile a module from bytecode you can look
up all of its exports and get the indices for the names. This is important
later.</p>
<p>Imports have <em>two</em>-level names: a namespace and a name. The idea is for
integrations to both be able to provide multiple libraries of imports without
clashes, and to support plugging one module’s exports directly to another
module’s imports, presumably namespaced under the first module’s name, version,
some random string, etc.</p>
<p>In practice there are two namespaces worth knowing about: <code>env</code> is the de-facto
default namespace, and <code>js</code> is the de-facto namespace for web APIs.</p>
<p>In Rust, to specify the import namespace (defaults to <code>env</code>), you need to use
the <code>#[link(wasm_import_namespace = "foo")]</code> attribute on the extern block like
so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[link(wasm_import_namespace = "log")]
extern {
   fn trace(ptr: i32, len: i32);
   fn debug(ptr: i32, len: i32);
   fn info(ptr: i32, len: i32);
   fn warn(ptr: i32, len: i32);
   fn error(ptr: i32, len: i32);
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="functions-calls"><a class="header" href="#functions-calls">Functions calls</a></h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://wasmer.io">wasmer</a> runtime, which is what I’ve most experience with, there are two
contexts to call exported functions in: on an <code>Instance</code>, that is, once a
compiled module is instantiated (we’ll come back to that), and from a <code>Ctx</code>,
that is, from inside an imported function call. The first is highly ergonomic,
the other not very (this will probably improve going forward, there’s no reason
not to).</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let func: Func&lt;(i32, i32)&gt; = instance.func("foo_functer")?;
let res = func.call(42, 43)?;</code></pre>
<p>To call from a <code>Ctx</code>, the best way currently is to pre-emptively (before
instantiating) obtain the indices of the exported functions you want to call
from the compiled module, and then call into the <code>Ctx</code> using those indices:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// after compiling, with a Module
let export_index = module
    .info()
    .exports
    .get("foo_functer")
    .unwrap();

let func_index = if let ExportIndex::Func(func_index) = export_index {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute(*func_index) }
} else {
    panic!("aaah");
}

// inside an imported function, with a Ctx
let foo = 42;
let fun = 43;

let res = ctx.call_with_table_index(
    func_index,
    &amp;[WasmValue::I32(foo as _), WasmValue::I32(fun as _)],
)?;</code></pre>
<h2 id="multi-value"><a class="header" href="#multi-value">Multi-value</a></h2>
<p>Something that is not obvious at first glance is that multi-value returns in
wasm is comparatively young and not very well supported, which presents nasty
surprises when trying to use it in all but the most trivial cases.</p>
<p>Multi-value [return] is when wasm functions support multiple return values
instead of just one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wat">(func $readTwoI32s (param $offset i32) (result i32 i32)
   (i32.load (local.get $offset))
   (i32.load (i32.add (local.get $offset) (i32.const 4)))
)
</code></pre>
<p>To compile that with wat2wasm, you need the <code>--enable-multi-value</code> flag, which
should have been a… flag… that this wasn’t quite as well-supported as the
current spec made it out to be.</p>
<p>However, wasmer supports multi-value like a champ, both for calling exports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let func: Func&lt;(i32), (i32, i32)&gt; = instance.func("read_two_i32s")?;
let (one, two) = func.call(0)?;</code></pre>
<p>and for defining imports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">imports! {
   "env" =&gt; {
      "get_two_i64s" =&gt; func!(|| -&gt; (i64, i64) {
         (41, 42)
      }),
   },
};</code></pre>
<p>That initially lulled me in a false sense of security and I went about
designing APIs using multi-value and testing them with multi-value hand-written
wat. All seemed great!</p>
<p>Then I tried using Rust to write wasm modules that used my APIs and everything
fell apart because Rust does not support multi-value for Wasm… and lies to
you when you try using it.</p>
<p>See, Rust uses some kind of “C-like” ABI to do the codegen for its imports and
exports in its wasm support, such that if you write this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern {
   fn get_two_i64s() -&gt; (i64, i64);
}</code></pre>
<p>with multi-value you might expect this wasm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wat">(func (export "get_two_i64s") (result i64 i64))
</code></pre>
<p>but what you actually get is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wat">(func (export "get_two_i64s") (param i32))
</code></pre>
<p>Uhhh???</p>
<p>What Rust is actually exporting is a function that would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern {
   fn get_two_i64s(pointer_to_write_to: u32);
}</code></pre>
<p>which you’d then call like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut buf: [i64; 2] = [0; 2];
unsafe { get_two_i64s(buf.as_mut_ptr()); }
let [a, b] = buf;</code></pre>
<p>So now both sides have to know that <code>get_two_i64s</code> expects to write two i64s
contiguously somewhere in memory you specify, and then you retrieve that.</p>
<p>The wasmrust “framework” <em>does</em> support multi-value. It doesn’t magically
activate a hidden rustc flag to enable multi-value codegen, though: it
<em>post-processes the wasm</em>, looks for “things that look like they’re multi-value
functions”, and <em>writes them a wrapper that is multi-value</em>, leaving the
originals in place so you can use <em>both</em> styles. What the actual fuck.</p>
<p>I’m sure it works great with the limited API style that wasmrust’s bindgen
macros write out, and I’m sure it was a lot easier to do this than to add
multi-value support to Rustc, but it sure seems like a huge kludge.</p>
<p>Anyway, so: multi-value is sexy, but don’t even bother with it.</p>
<h2 id="instantiation-and-the-start-section"><a class="header" href="#instantiation-and-the-start-section">Instantiation and the start section</a></h2>
<p>Wasm modules can contain a <code>start</code> section, which can <strong>absolutely not</strong> be
thought of like a <code>main</code> function in C and Rust: code that runs directly,
without being called via an exported function.</p>
<p>The <code>start</code> section is run during the instantiation sequence.
If there’s no <code>start</code> section, it’s not called, simple as that.</p>
<p>Now, wasm people will insist that the <code>start</code> section is a compiler detail that
should absolutely not be used by common plebeians or for programs and such,
that it’s useless anyway because it runs before “the module” and “exports” are
available, and that implicitely <code>export</code>ed functions rely on the <code>start</code> having
been run, so you really shouldn’t use this for anything…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can’t generate it.</p>
<p>And fair enough. I’m sure they know their stuff and they have good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>. The instantiation process for Wasm is <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/modules.html#exec-instantiation">precisely defined</a>.
<em>After</em> this process, the module is ready for use. Wonderful. <strong>The <code>start</code>
section is called as the very last step of the instantiation process.</strong></p>
<p>So while the official advice is to have some export named, e.g. <code>main</code> or
something and then having the runtime call this export straight away, if you
want to deliberately flout the guidelines, <em>you probably can</em>. You can totally
use the instantiation of a module as a kind of glorified function call.</p>
<p>It’s most certainly a bad idea… but you can.</p>
<p>Given that nothing will generate this for you, you’ll need to post-process the
wasm to add the <code>start</code> section in yourself. A small price to pay. (Seriously,
though: don’t. It’s all fun and games until nasal daemons eat your laundry, and
again, <em>nothing supports this</em>.)</p>
<h2 id="types"><a class="header" href="#types">Types</a></h2>
<p>People usually start with that, but it’s kind of an implementation detail in
most cases, and then they leave it at that… there’s some good bits there,
though.</p>
<p>As a recap, Wasm at the moment has 2×2 scalar types: signed ints and floats,
both in 32 and 64 bit widths, plus one 128-bit vector type for SIMD (when
supported).</p>
<p>To start with, you can’t pass 128-bit integers in using v128. Good try!</p>
<p>The wasm pointer size wasm is 32 bits. Period. There’s effectively no wasm64 at
this point, even though it’s specced and mentioned in a few places. If you’re
writing an integration and need to store or deal with pointers from inside
wasm, don’t bother with usize and perhaps-faillible casts, use u32 and cast up
to usize when needed (e.g. when indexing into memories). Then pop this up in
your code somewhere to be overkill in making sure that cast is always safe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[cfg(not(any(target_pointer_width = "32", target_pointer_width = "64")))]
compile_error!("only 32 and 64 bit pointers are supported");</code></pre>
<p>When engines have magical support for unsigned and smaller width integers,
that’s all convention between the two sides. <code>u8</code> and <code>i16</code> and <code>u32</code> are cast
to 8, 16, or 32 bits, padded out, given to wasm as an “<code>i32</code>”, and then the
inner module re-interprets the bits as the right type… if it wants to. Again,
it’s all convention. Make sure everything is documented, because if you pass
–2079915776 (<code>i32</code>) and meant 2215051520 (<code>u32</code>), well, who could have known?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 February 2018</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today at work I made this up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">async function* init_process (steps) {
   for (let step of steps) {
      while (true) {
         try {
            await step.run()
            break
         } catch (error) {
            handle_error({ step, error })
            yield
         }
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What this does is it takes a list of <code>steps</code>, which are async tasks (in our
case a request and some processing), runs through them, and if there is an
error at some point it hands back to the caller… and then the caller can
choose to <em>retry the failed step and go on</em>.</p>
<p>All in 10 lines of code.</p>
<p>Beyond brevity, what I like about this code is that as long as you know the
behaviour of an async generator, of <code>break</code> inside a loop, of a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> —
which are all, to the possible exception of the async generator, fairly
elemental language structures — you can understand what this little machine
does simply by running through it line by line, iteration by iteration.</p>
<p>Here’s how you’d use this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// load the steps, do some prep work...

// Prepare the little machine
const process = init_process(steps)

// Hook up the retry button
$('.retry-button').click(() =&gt; process.next())

// Start it up
process.next()
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it!</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s run through this a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>async function* init_process (steps) {</code></p>
<p>This is an Async Generator that takes a list of <code>steps</code>. Generators, and
Async Generators, gets their arguments and then start <em>frozen</em>. They don’t
do any processing until you first call <code>.next()</code>.</p>
<p>An Async Generator is just a Generator! All it does special is that you can
use <code>await</code> inside it and if you want the results of what it <code>yield</code>s, you
have to await those. (But we don’t use that here so you don’t even need to
keep that in mind.) There’s no extra magic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>for (let step of steps) {</code></p>
<p>We’re going to iterate through all the steps, one at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>while (true) {</code></p>
<p>This is the first “aha!” moment. To make it possible to <em>retry</em> the current,
failed, step, we start an infinite loop. If we have a success, we can break
out of it, dropping back into… the <code>for</code> loop, and thus continuing onto
the next step. If we have a failure, we <em>don’t</em> break out, and the <code>while</code>
loop will naturally start that step over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>try { await step.run(); break</code></p>
<p>We <code>try</code> the <code>step.run()</code>, and then we <code>break</code>. Because of the way
exceptions work, <code>break</code> will <em>only run if nothing was thrown</em>. That is, if
<code>step.run()</code> ended successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>catch (error) { handle_error({ step, error })</code></p>
<p>We want to immediately handle the error. We <em>could</em> <code>yield</code> the error and
let the caller handle it, but this way there’s no need for an extra wrapping
function: we can just call <code>process.next()</code> to start and resume the machine,
without needing to care about its output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>yield</code></p>
<p>The piece of magic that brings it all together. If and when we get to that,
we <em>freeze</em> the generator state and hand back execution to the caller. It’s
now up to it to tell the little machine to continue, and it can do that at
any time. There’s no need for complex state management, of preserving and
restoring progress: the language itself is taking care of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside: <code>process.next()</code> (the first time)</p>
<p>Recall that the Generator starts <em>frozen</em> (see 1). The first thing we do is
call <code>next()</code>, and that unfreezes the machine. It starts processing steps,
and eventually will either get to the end, or stop at an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To retry: <code>process.next()</code></p>
<p>When we hit a snag, <code>handle_error()</code> does its job of telling the user and
figuring out problems… and then it can choose to display a retry button.
Or maybe it will want to automatically retry a step if it deems it safe to
do so. Or maybe the error was very bad, and it just wants to abort. It can
do all these things, and it can take its time: the little machine will wait
patiently until it’s told to get going again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>September 2016</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This week I discovered that one of my all-time favourite comics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_(comics)">Gaston Lagaffe</a>, was never translated into English. Ever. <em>(Update March 2022: It still hasn’t been translated, but a new volume is getting published by Dupuis, so there might be hope!)</em></p>
<p>I find that really sad because Gaston was, and still is, a comic I read when I was growing up, and I wish more people I live with (in a global sense, as in my local community) and work with and laugh with… also had read it.</p>
<p>But more than that, it’s because Gaston is a geek. No, ever better, he’s the evolution of the high school geek into adulthood. And, to me, he’s the answer to the cry for help and representation of geeks <em>in</em> high school.</p>
<p>You see, I can’t help but compare with American comics, especially American comics that are (stereotypically, perhaps) read and adored by American/English-speaking geeks while growing up. I don’t think they do a very good job of creating a positive geek attitude to life. Maybe that’s just my flawed perspective as someone who didn’t grow up with them though.</p>
<p><strong>Spiderman</strong> leads a double life: he’s a despised science geek and a revered superhero. The tensions between those two identities are already well-addressed, but I think they’re tensions because Peter Parker <em>doesn’t want to be a despised geek</em>. This is critical. He might grow beyond it later, but from the very introduction of the character, we have a geek who hates that he’s a geek, and craves to be “normal” and have the attention of, at a pick, love interests and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Superman</strong> is also an irrelevant and socially awkward Clark Kent, who (surprise) has trouble getting the attention of his love interest. Both as the superhero <em>and</em> as the non-super he has this notion of “fighting for the little guy.” Where Spiderman is a direct incarnation of geeks and their dreams, Superman is more of a defender of the weak.</p>
<p>Jack Kirby on the <strong>X-Men</strong>, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would you do with mutants who were <em>just plain boys and girls</em> and certainly not dangerous? You school them. You develop their skills. So I gave them a teacher, Professor X. Of course, it was the natural thing to do, instead of disorienting or alienating people who were different from us, I made the X-Men part of the human race, which they were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With few exceptions, the narrative as it applies to geeks here is largely negative. Sure, it represents geeks and allows a veneer of legitimacy, but the only way to be acknowledged by whomever one wants (girls, boys, authority, the public at large…) is to become someone else.</p>
<p>Yet we geeks of the real world <em>can’t do that</em>. We don’t have superpowers, alien origins, or life-enhancing serums. And try as we might, actually getting to be acknowledged and accepted in society requires a lot of work and time and practice and experience. And it requires failure.</p>
<p>This is what <strong>Gaston</strong> represents, to me. Let me introduce you. This is Gaston:</p>
<p><img src="musings/gaston-lagaffe/tripping.jpg" alt="Gaston tripping on a can" /></p>
<p>He’s an office junior in a busy publication house. He’s clumsy, lazy, easy-going, socially-awkward, and an unrecognised genius. This is one of his minor inventions, a radio-controlled lawn mower:</p>
<p><img src="musings/gaston-lagaffe/lawn-mower.jpg" alt="Gaston falls asleep mowing the lawn" /></p>
<p>He also probably has some ADHD symptoms, or at least <a href="https://medium.com/@randileeharper/mental-health-adhd-ca63b1836fa1">that thing where you have a million ideas and can’t focus on what you’re supposed to be doing</a>. So he has a radical solution: he goes and creates those ideas. He follows the threads and does stuff.</p>
<p><img src="musings/gaston-lagaffe/ideas.jpg" alt="A few of Gaston’s ideas" /></p>
<p>And yet, Gaston is hopelessly out of society’s proper functioning. He isn’t a role model: this isn’t someone you want to emulate in every way. He’s not successful, he doesn’t have the recognition of his peers, and he’s still despised by “normals”. But this is also precisely why I think he is a better representation for geeks.</p>
<p>You see, he <em>doesn’t want these things</em>. He’s not successful by society’s standards, but he has fun and creates a bunch of things and clearly believes he’s doing pretty well, by <em>his</em> standards. He doesn’t have the recognition of his peers, but he has good friends who are more or less as quirky as he is, and accept him for who he his. Even those who initially despise him come to a grudging respect and even occasional admiration.</p>
<p><img src="musings/gaston-lagaffe/labyrinth.jpg" alt="Gaston’s library labyrinth" /></p>
<p>For most of the series, he has a romantic aspiration with another character, but, until the very end, it’s an asexual relationship. And it’s not just that our antihero is too socially awkward to initiate sex: no, both of them are happy in the relationship they share.</p>
<p>But most importantly, Gaston fails. A lot.</p>
<p><img src="musings/gaston-lagaffe/oops.jpg" alt="Gaston and chemicals make very good friends" /></p>
<p>This is a funny comic strip, and many of the gags feature Gaston’s inventions, ideas, setups, and other creations going wrong, either at his or others’ expense. He fails and fails and yet never fails to get back up and go on.</p>
<p>Gaston is never angsty nor brooding; he might not be a regular member of society but doesn’t yearn for it either. Gaston is happy in life, without denying who he is, without aspiring to be someone else, without needing extraordinary powers to accomplish any of this. He’s just himself, and he’s just fine.</p>
<p>And, really, that’s all I’ve ever wanted.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="known-unknowns-a-configuration-language"><a class="header" href="#known-unknowns-a-configuration-language">Known Unknowns: a configuration language</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>8 August 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, I want a configuration pre-processor that is fully typed, but has a concept of “holes” or
“unknowns”. As you compile your configuration, the compiler tells you if there are any unknowns it
still needs to finish the process. Furthermore, you can instruct it to “expand” the source as far as
it can go with what it has, and leave the unknowns there. You can then store or pass on this result
to some other component or system.</p>
<p>This is essentially full-document currying: you’re filling all the variables you have, and until
every variable is filled in, the result is still a function of further inputs.</p>
<p>Why would this be useful? Well, think of a configuration like Ansible or Terraform, where some
variables might be remote to your local system, or be dependent on context. You could write a
network configuration, for example, that needs the name of the main interface to really proceed. You
then write a config within the typesystem, which enforces at the type level things like providing
either a static IP xor DHCP=true. You compile this config, and the compiler expands the typesystem
out to a Netplan config shaped intermediate form, and tells you its known unknowns, in this case the
interface name. You can manually check over the config to see that it’s what you meant. You can then
give that to Ansible for a dry-run, which will go and fetch the interface name from the running
system (an operation with no side effects, so available in a <em>dry</em> run), and complete the config.
With no unknowns remaining, only a Netplan config remains. You can still manually check over the
final output, before the “wet” run applies it.</p>
<p>Do that on a wider scale, and you get a powerful system that, instead of throwing an error if
something is missing, tells you what is missing and also provides useful output even with the
missing bits. You can have as many steps as needed: pregenerate a large config, use it to derive
where to look for missing data, ask a human for input for more unknowns, fetch more data from
places, and only once everything is filled in can you apply it.</p>
<p>You can install configs with known unknowns on a system, so long as the consuming application will
be able to fill those in.</p>
<p>You can “pass” a config along different departments, which each filling in their bits. For example
make a request for a new virtual machine, which you require to have some memory, some disk, and
running a specific OS. Pass that on to Network, which assigns an IP, subnet, virtual LAN; pass it on
to Storage, which reserves block storage and fills in which datastore it needs to be in; pass it on
to Approval which reviews and adds authentication; pass it back to the requester, who adds their SSH
keys and checks it against what they passed on originally for any modification.</p>
<p>You can go a bit deeper in the analysis, and figure out which <em>parts</em> of a document depend on
unknowns, and which don’t. You can have unknowns that are partially filled in by other unknowns.
You can do dead unknown elimination and get warnings when a configuration would not use an unknown
in the final output.</p>
<p>You could even have partial “wet” runs that do as much as possible until they find an unknown, and
because the unknowns can be known beforehand, statically, you can skip over them instead of stopping
at the first one.</p>
<p>You could run simulations by filling unknowns with fake values, and seeing how that behaves.
That could be really powerful to make even more advanced dry runs.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a fairly nebulous idea at this point, but I feel it would be a <em>lot</em> more useful than a
<a href="musings/../technical/dhall-review.html">programming typesystem applied to configuration</a>, which requires that all types and holes
are resolved ahead of time.</p>
<p>Another project on the pile…</p>

<h2 id="unblocking-the-wrongfully-blocked"><a class="header" href="#unblocking-the-wrongfully-blocked">Unblocking the wrongfully-blocked</a></h2>
<p>…is something I’d love to do, but the difficulty is <em>identifying</em> who is really truly wrongly-blocked.
For a sense of scale, at last accurate count in 2019, I had well over 150 000 blocks on Twitter. I would estimate
having about 200 000 now. Reviewing a block is a forensic process, because as I’ll explain, you cannot just rely
on metadata like who follows someone or their bio. Let’s have an extremely optimistic estimate of an average of
two minutes per wrongful block, and ten seconds per rightful block. If <em>everyone I’ve blocked</em> should
remain there, hand-reviewing the entire list to assure myself of that would take <strong>24 days of non-stop work</strong>.
When I say non-stop, I mean it would take <strong>over 550 hours</strong>. If I have even <em>two percent</em> of
wrongful blocks, that inflates to <strong>over 670 hours</strong>. It’s an enormous amount of work.</p>
<p>But surely, I can automate a large part of it. Reader, I tried. Over several months. It turned out that my block list
is extremely varied. Or rather, the people on it are varied. Or rather, the way the people on it present to me, the
information I have available about them, is extremely varied. I don’t have much: I have their username, display name,
bio, location and website fields, and maybe a few of their tweets if I write some scripts. I can put all that in a
database, so I can process the large amounts of information all of this adds up to. And then what?</p>
<p>There are some terms in bio I can outright block, right? Like <code>MAGA</code>. Right?
<a href="https://twitter.com/haaspolicy">Right?</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/JoJoMorr1231">R</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/e_whittler">i</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/WestsideFireman">g</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/littlebit_mia">h</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/madumaga">t</a>
?</p>
<p>Well, fuck. (For the record, five links above contained text such as “I will block MAGA trolls”, and one is someone
literally named Madumaga.) And I don’t even follow any of these people, this is just 30 seconds of searching. Okay,
maybe exclude the ones that mention <code>MAGA</code> and <code>block</code>, or <code>MAGA</code> and <code>troll</code>, or some other combinations, surely that
would work, <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyCreollady2">right</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cat_conserva">Lol, fuck.</a></p>
<p>Okay but surely someone who only has the word <code>MAGA</code> and not any of these other ones is a real one, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KayaJade19">LMAO GTFOH</a></p>
<p>(For the record, the first two are genuine MAGA people who block <em>anti</em>-MAGA “trolls” and the last one is a genuine
person whose bio speaks, without using any of the obvious keywords, of them being previously banned due to harassment
<em>by</em> MAGA people.)</p>
<p>And this is a comparitively simple one. Try to do the same for transphobes, and it’s a quagmire. But hold on, maybe I should
do the inverse and identify people who are <em>clearly</em> not transphobes. Like, maybe someone who has pronouns in their bio
and identifies as trans is fairly easy to search for? And surely <em>they</em> would be on the “unblock” candidate list?
Boy oh boy. For one thing, truscums are a thing. For another, <em><strong>intersectionality cuts both ways</strong></em>.</p>
<p>See, it’s perfectly possible to have trans racists, gay sexists, lesbian transphobes, feminist anti-vaxxers.
Assholes often have layers. But also, everyone can be an asshole. There is not a single group of people whose grouping
attribute makes them free of the potential to be an asshole.</p>
<p>Even if there was, there would be no reliable way to
identify that group from their bio, or who they follow, or who they’re followed by, or even scanning some of their
tweets.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Simple thought experiment: say there is such a marker. What is the first harasser who comes
across it gonna do?</p>
<h2 id="forgiveness"><a class="header" href="#forgiveness">Forgiveness</a></h2>
<p>And then there’s forgiveness. There’s a service run by fellow kiwi <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman">Tom Eastman</a>
called <a href="https://secateur.app">Secateur</a> which lets you block people (and optionally all their followers,
it’s the “block script” I mention in one of the historical block reasons above) <em>temporarily</em>. The idea is this: people change.
So blocking them now might be good, but they might see the error of their ways or listen to the right person or learn some <em>damn</em>
empathy somehow, and now they’re not someone you want to block anymore, right?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why I don’t use it or something like it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s another tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>I block a lot. I block quickly, I don’t take two minutes to think about it. I block on tweetdeck,
I block on mobile. It’s never going to be a good fit for me to have to open a separate app, copy or type a username
across, and hit go. That’s too much work. 99% of the time,† I just want to block and move on.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I don’t think automated forgiveness is the way to go.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Because</em> of all the wrongly-blocked, I am also fairly fast at unblocking if someone who is blocked
appears in a conversation with people I trust, and a browse of their tweets doesn’t
bring up any red flags. The idea there is: if you’re block-worthy, surely I’ll block you again.
So, if you’ve changed, and you intersect my life, chances are I’ll just unblock you outright. But if you haven’t,
I don’t actually want the app to unblock you. And there’s no way for the app to tell.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Blocking isn’t just for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blocking someone means they can’t see my tweets, and that includes replies to people, among
other interactions. Blocking someone stops them interacting with me, but it also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stops them interacting with others through me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stops me accidentally retweeting one of their viral tweets later on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helps protect people I interact with who <em>haven’t</em> blocked them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>protects people I interact with who <em>have</em>, or are private.</p>
<p>Have you ever read a twitter conversation where one side is public and the other is a private
account? You can still figure out a lot from one side, right? That’s what I’m talking about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>†: I occasionally use the <a href="https://megablock.xyz">megablock.xyz</a> app as a one off for especially egregious cases.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>Maybe I should just unblock everyone, do a great big reset, and then restart my block list from nil, confident that <em>from now on</em>
I’ll only block the deserving.</p>
<p>I don’t think so. I believe that my block list truly makes my twitter experience better, and resetting it would make it materially worse.
Maybe not immediately, but certainly in the longer term.</p>
<p>Overall, the cold final part of it is that I believe that the cost is worth it. That whatever small percentage of people I have wrongly
blocked is not significant enough to detract from the amount of good and comfort that having the rest rightfully blocked grants me.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="on-invoking-deities"><a class="header" href="#on-invoking-deities">On Invoking Deities</a></h1>
<p>I hold a particular belief that I… don’t really talk about because I also have a deep loathing
for all forms of proselytising (the concept of “software evangelism” makes me uncomfortable, and
especially so when that is a titled position at a company someone can be hired for. Ick.).</p>
<p>It is that non-consensually invoking deities is, at best, rude.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invoking one’s own deity, or a spiritual presence one worships or follows, is an invitation for
that being to take notice of you, and of your surroundings. Doing so in the presence and to the
face of someone who is <em>not</em> expecting that kind of attention is at best rude, if that person
also happens to follow your same set of beliefs. If that person is following a <em>different</em> one
it’s even more distasteful, at best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoking someone else’s deity or spiritual etc when you do not subscribe to them yourself is
also rude and potentially an affront.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking for a blessing from your patron spirits onto someone who has not consented to being brought
to the attention of said spirit could well be considered an indirect attack. Asking for a blessing
from deities you don’t even subscribe to is just plain weird to do directly, though soliciting
attention from ones <em>via</em> people who <em>are</em> is acceptable (so long as they consent to).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this all applies even though I am an atheist. One could think that as an atheist I wouldn’t
care about “imaginary beings taking imaginary attention to me,” but I suppose I am very slightly on
the agnostic side for that: in the optic that “we can’t be sure,” I would say it would be <em>prudent</em>
to not randomly invoke gods and goddesses for no fucking reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is to say, I understand it is a very ingrained <em>tic</em> in the English language to do so
all the bloody time, but if you can at all refrain, please do <em>not</em> say “oh my —” at me.
Especially if you don’t actually have religious beliefs, that just feels super weird to me. Why.</p>
<p>Less controversial perhaps, saying “— bless you” is also off. Saying <em>just</em> “bless you” is…
marginally okay, only in that it can probably be “I bless you” or something, like you’re bestowing
the blessing, you’re not invoking some extra-universal entity to pull on the fabric of spacetime
to arrange things my way. If you want to be all proper about it you could ask for permission; it’s
not something very done in these times, but it could stand to make a comeback.</p>

<p>Yes, your religion’s dictate to preach at everything that moves is extremely fucking creepy, even if
you phrase all your preaching as “look at what my deity did for me” or “how good is my god, hallowed
be his name.” The <em>intent</em> is to “spread the good word” on the people who have, frankly, not asked
for any of your shite.</p>

<p>I have an <a href="https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-6-3d-printer">Ender 6</a> 3D printer.
Here are some models I have designed and printed with it:</p>

<li><a href="models/./mijia-hang/index.html">Mijia Hang</a>: a little outdoor housing for a Mijia Thermometer.</li>

</ul>
<p>This is a two-piece plant pot for herbs that can be set on a surface or hung
from two screws into a fence or wall. The bottom part is a water reservoir with
overflow holes, and the top part is where the dirt and plant goes. It has drain
holes that are sufficiently large to allow roots to reach through; so these can
be watered both from above and below.</p>
<p>The square shape means plants can be rotated along cardinals to change
orientation e.g. for sun. The pot is small enough to be grasped in one hand to
lift it, and strong enough to resist a few falls from storms.</p>
<p>Designed in <a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad">OpenSCAD</a> (master branch,
since the last “release” as of writing was in 2021, even though it’s been in
active development all along… <a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/3640">release a few betas or something

<li>Print time: 4-5 hours</li>

</ul>
<p>This is a two-piece bird-cage-shaped hanging enclosure that I designed to house
a <a href="https://www.getdget.com.au/xiaomi-mijia-bluetooth-thermometer-hydrometer-2-smart-lcd-digital-display-temperature-humidity-sensor.html">Xiaomi / Mijia Temperature + Humidity sensor</a>.
The sensor costs $10-$20 depending where you get it from, can easily be flashed
with custom firmware, is powered from a single 2032, and is trivial to hook up
to Home Assistant.</p>
<p>However, it’s an indoors device. I wanted to measure outdoor temperature for
comparison, so I made this box which can be hung under eaves or from a hook
(preferably somewhere shaded, but works okay with sun exposure too). The bottom
can be removed by rotating it until it aligns with the slots; that provides
access so the battery can be changed easily.</p>
<p>The sides of the case is pierced with 31 holes, which are angled so rain cannot
penetrate. They are arranged in three rows, of 7, 11, and 13 holes. This is one
of my favourite pattern tricks: because the amount of holes are prime numbers,
the overall pattern doesn’t repeat or align: it would take the <em>product</em> of the
three numbers, 1001 intervals, to see a repeat or alignment.</p>

<p>This is a two-piece, two-prints case for filament reels. The idea is to have
circular boxes which themselves can behave as reels (they can be set on a
spindle), and which contain the actual reel. A small hole with a seal limits
the air/humidity intake while allowing the filament to unspool, a space for
dessicant helps keep the inside dry.</p>

Void and nothingness</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>Alya told me to repeat this every time I was scared. Before I went to sleep. Before I started my day. Before I fell away into the night. The words don’t mean much, and it’s not the order or the rhythm that’s soothing. The mantra is just something to concentrate on, to repeat, into nothingness and void, once and forever, over and over, until all that remains in the world is me and you. That’s the first part, the first line of the mantra that Alya taught me: “You and me”. But I removed it when she went. It’s too hard getting my heart broken twice, when she went and when I didn’t, so getting my heart broken every time I get scared is impossible. Zero one two three.</p>

Are we out of night?</p>

Our life, for years now, has bled</p>
<p>Burn our secrets<br />
Burn our hearts<br />
Burn our love</p>

to go soaring into the skies<br />

A red sunset<br />
A tide coming out<br />
My soul drying out.</p>

<p>You told us to run<br />
You told us to be free<br />
You kept our secrets<br />
You were broken for us<br />
Still you did not speak</p>
<p>We thank you<br />
We thank you<br />
We thank you all</p>
<p>We will remember you<br />
We’ve built monuments<br />
We’re telling stories</p>
<p>At long last, with tyranny defeated<br />
We stand here honouring you<br />
Who made it all possible<br />
But didn’t get to see the end</p>
<p>We weep for the fallen<br />
We run into the sky<br />
We smile true to our soul<br />
We remember who we are<br />
We restore our hearts<br />
We return to ourselves<br />
We heal the scars<br />
We dream at night<br />
We weep for the fallen</p>
<p>The toll has rung one final time.</p>

<p>You think you are out there exploring the limits.</p>
<p>The limits of the possible,<br />
the limits of the feasible,<br />
the limits of the thinkable.</p>
<p>The limits of the imaginable.</p>
<p>And we smile, when we see you, children that you are, afloat on top of this
lake you call an ocean. You are flotillas and armadas and solo navigators and
skilled amateurs slashing these waters. You are working, in unison or in
competition or in solitaire independence, to perfect the art: in as little
movement, in some set distances, in tiny vessels, and even without sails.</p>
<p>And we smile, when we see you, children.</p>
<p>We work beneath the surface. We work above the skies. We crawl around the
bottom of the seas. We move earth, and air, and fish. We summon thunder.</p>
<p>We work.</p>
<p>Days, weeks, decades, lifetimes.</p>
<p>We know of the monsters. You scoff at the stories. Even when provided with
pictures, you imagine small beasts, that could not possibly be a threat except
perhaps when alone and unprepared.</p>
<p>We have been alone.</p>
<p>And the monsters we know, they are taller than we are.</p>
<p>In deep, where they live, we learn to be quiet. To do our work, as grandiose

these hell-beasts of your nightmares.</p>
<p>We build defenses. Intricate and complex to the initiated, they look repetitive
and primitive to the neophyte. We like them. They give us comfort.</p>
<p>We protect you, without you ever knowing. A ripple on the water where none
should have been is a failure of our task. When we are at our best, you do not
see us.</p>
<p>The tools you use and improve and congratulate yourselves for bringing further
than ever, we have as base part of our kit. For the work, though, diversity is
everything. Where you might sharpen your words on an ever-growing collection of
still lives, we battle in the deep, we love, we hate, we die, we bear, we
spawn, we solve, we ponder.</p>
<p>We do not resent you not knowing.</p>
<p>It is the work. It is the life.</p>
<p>It is innocence worth protecting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>28 October 2008</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The box was simple. It was hand-crafted, seemingly by inexperienced hands. The
lid was not attached to it, except for two mould-eaten strings, passed through
rough holes in the wood. There were carvings on its top: words now unredable,
names, a heart, crossed out by later cuts. Several layers of time were printed
there; past drawings, gone relationships, ancient memories.</p>
<p>When I opened the box, it was as if I’d opened an old book. The same odour, the
mark of time. The same resistance, this reticence of giving up secrets.</p>
<p>Dust spiraled under my breath. When it fell back, the content of the box, those
pieces of childhood, were finally exposed to my sight. They seemed still
defiant, as if daring me to uncover their stories.</p>
<p>A pair of little scissors and cotton string were the first things. The seemed
to have been placed there in a rush, just before moving out of home. Pence
coins, saved and never used. Several badges from the scouts. Love letters, with
Xs in faded ink. Had they been received and kept? Or were they still waiting to
be posted?</p>
<p>Further in the shade were deeper souvenirs. Diving into the swirls of dust, my
eye caught on toys and objects only precious here. Glass marbles, scratched and
marked, reflecting older games. Short pencils, used by force of fingers,
sharpened with quick strokes of a knife. The knife itself, its steel blade
half-open, shining still, having won its fight against time and rust. A little
vial, empty now. Two little stones, black jewels in the dark.</p>
<p>Going back to the source, the beginning: the last objects, first put, unveiled
from time. A sepia photograph of a baby. A name engraved in a bracelet. A
petite cloth doll, of a rabbit. First fallen tooth, neatly labeled. Finally, a
little card with a name and these words: “If by any luck you found this box,
could you please return it to me.”</p>
<p>I looked up the name. Ten minutes later, when a heavy door opened and a
grandmother looked at me, somewhat intrigued, I asked: “Is this yours?”</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-man"><a class="header" href="#a-man">A Man</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>13 February 2011</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was lit up faintly.</p>
<p>Standing in a room of golden proportions (which is not saying a lot), he was one stood man (which is). The only lamp, a seemingly old neon, hanging short from its chains, shone darkly above none. None but a five-feeted glass plane, upon which glossy pages were desperately eager to tan; but alas! not one ever did lift their covers.</p>
<p>The man had been looked upon countless times, even through his short while standing. Always from the top, which might be explained by his stature, or might not. His hair, though, was all but feature-less. A few curls only stood out from otherwise straight, short mop. His visage was no different: sharp edges and soft skin were its only characteristics. Immaculate white collar. Iridescent black blazer. No tie. Dark pants, which pockets concealed fine hands (five of them, two of flesh). Polished shoes. Neat.</p>
<p>Above his socks, through the shadow, a lighter strip revealed — no, confirmed — what one could have mistaken for tan earlier. Yes indeed; the man was a lone, black white cream, wolf.</p>
<p>Behind blue eyes, the man was impatient. His feet were hurting. Had someone spoke to him at that very instant (as the next it was gone), he would have answered softly, non-committally; in his mind, however, his voice clear and his tone dry, he would have snapped, glaring. But etiquette ruled over him. Earlier, he had risen for that same reason from his seat and let another take it, damning both the old dear for entering, and the owner for the number of chairs. Her feeble thanks had irritated him, and he had not replied. He now damned both himself for this lack of respect, and his long gone ancestors (only from his mother’s side) for having instated and enforced this ridicule heap of codes and laws.</p>
<p>A sparrow, love, and a brightness in his mind entered through the far door and kissed him quickly and sweetly.</p>
<p>Arm in arm, they left.</p>

<p>We lived forever, and would live forever.<br />
So we had concluded.</p>
<p>We didn’t know, of course, because none can predict the future. But we had
attempted everything, and still, we lived. We had watched, in the meantime,
people come and go, countries come and go, peoples come and go. Some of us
helped, to make them come, or to make them go. We clashed, albeit rarely one
against another; such conflicts rarely went how we wished. It would not be
accurate to say we warred: we made war, but we didn’t hurt ourselves. Rather,
those we lead and guided were hurt, and made hurt, and did hurt.</p>
<p>It took us a century to meet again, all together. And we stayed together for
almost a decade, casting off from the world, metaphorically. We made peace.</p>
<p>The world outside raged on.</p>
<p>In all reunions going forward, we regretted, all of us, for that first moment
of selfishness. It had taken us a century to make peace among ourselves, at
little cost to us, given we would live forever, and at excruciating cost to
everyone else, given that they didn’t. It took us, to our eternal shame, one
other century to not only repair the damage we had sown, but to help all of
them, all mortal people, to make peace. Now, they lived longer.</p>
<p>We split in four: some worked on prosperity, to make the world the best we
could, not for us, but for them; some worked on space, to explore and move
there, to make inhabitable, to help prosperity; some worked on knowledge, and
foremost, on understanding why we lived, to perhaps reverse it, or to perhaps
share it; some worked on the past, to find why and whom made us live forever,
to study their history, to help them remember it, such that both us and them
would endeavour not to repeat it, or at least not the bad parts.</p>
<p>As of this day, three score centuries on, before I leave for the stars,
uncertain to come back, we have not finished our work. Humanity has almost
forgotten us, all according to plan. They live, they think, forever — we know
otherwise, but still, we hope. Soon I embark. You who reads this, tell me:</p>
<p>how is Earth?</p>
<p>— Found in the Sechura Desert, Earth, in the hand of The Owlman, 9387 CE.</p>
<hr />
<p>P.S. Shortly after leaving, I made a discovery that let me finish my part of
our research: The Understanding. I came back here to leave you copies of my
notes and conclusions. Go find Jiang Maze, last I heard they were living in
the Phæthontis quadrangle on Mars. They are in charge of the relevant part
of The Past, and will find these notes interesting, as well as provide you,
most probably, with a cup of the finest tea in the Sol system, as dusk falls.</p>
<p>— Found in a decaying ATHENA ΑΘΕ telescope, in L2 orbit, Earth, 9411 CE.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope you’ve found the previous stashes useful, although there was something
missing, an unexplored thread in my research that will prove critical both in
the understanding and application of, at least, the last five stashes, and,
perhaps, a few more. While waiting on this rock, I have also branched off into
improvements which affect me directly, and will field test them soon. If you’re
interested in a potential 3% efficiency increase in FTL Type C drives — and
let’s be honest, who isn’t? — come find my next stop. If you can.</p>
<p>Nyctimene is bringing me away from the hubbub of the main elliptic plane of
the Sol system, perfect for a quiet and discreet jump. How was Maze’s tea?</p>
<p>— Found on 2150 Nyctimene, Sol system, 9436 CE.</p>
<hr />
<p>I thought I would spend an entire orbit here, on Dagon. I only lasted 400 years
before fancy made me take flight again. I have to say, as impressive as it was
to approach the Eye of Sauron, only to settle within its edge, it was nothing
compared to centuries of perpetual meteor showers. As usual, you’ll find my
notes and research here. There’s a lot; take your time. I endeavoured to keep
linguistic drift low, but I cannot control for how the common tongue will have
evolved while I was alone here, so I wish you luck, dear reader.</p>
<p>I have left a clock zeroed at my time of departure, for your information. It
should be precise for two millennia, beyond that, well. You’d be lagging anyway.</p>
<p>— Found in a shielded structure on Dagon, Fomalhaut system, 9520 CE.</p>
<hr />
<p>As mentioned in my last few notes, being around people once again has quite
well increased research avenues. Not only that, but I went and got up to date
with the current state of everything, and I even sent a few messages to my
colleagues of old, which prompted an impromptu reunion with those that happened
to be nearby. As a result, this stash is special! Sure, you’ll find the usual,
but there’s also a record of said reunion, and notes on those I met, along with
historical observations, recollections, and even archives dating back all the
way to my first millennium. I do not have the hubris to write conclusions and
analyses of that data, that and my colleagues might just take offence, but
perhaps you or yours will want a stab at the matter.</p>
<p>At my great surprise, although in hindsight it was inevitable, I found I liked
interacting with people, especially those younger than me (there’s a lot more,
and they’re not all people who have tried to kill me at some point; it was a
long time ago, and we’ve all moved past it — so we say). A bright new world
this is, after being alone so long. So, at my great surprise I started getting
attached to a few. As I write this, I know I’m leaving; they know I’m leaving.
And yet I also know I might come back, as my missing them will gnaw at me.</p>
<p>My destination is Antares, perhaps detouring via Betelgeuse, there’s a very
interesting research group drawing parallels between native species of the
two systems, hinting at another species being capable of space travel — now
that would be the greatest discovery, the crowning of a career, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>When you stop by, do make contact with my local fellow ancients, they’re
intrigued; and your news from Maze are the freshest they’ll get. Bring them
some tea, too, you know the one. Does it still have the scent of the moon?</p>
<p>— Found in a beach mansion on Aldébaran-4, Aldebaran system, 9566 CE.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is the last note there is. As of writing this, I have finished my era
of research and study and travels. Well, maybe not travels. I have made
friends here, and on Aldébaran-4, and around Betelgeuse, and elsewhere. I’ll
have to keep traveling, if only to visit them all. But my pursuit of
knowledge and understanding is well and truly over. I have, long ago, finished
my portion of the work assigned to me, and more. You’ll find next to this the
last details and conclusions regarding that and all other threads I was
exploring.</p>
<p>I find myself wondering if I’ll go back to Sol; probably not soon, but it’s
a possibility. One I would have never imagined when I started on this trip,
this exile, if you would. I have lived a very long while, and I have regretted
a great many events; it is only recently that I have been able to finally face
them, to forgive myself in a way; it is only recently that I have opened up
about them to another.</p>
<p>Perhaps, had I continued on my lonesome, you would eventually have heard these
grievances against myself… but these notes feel much too impersonal now. I
cannot help but feel incoming loss at stopping there, yet it is smaller than
the relief, and smaller still than the joy at being able to dedicate more of my
life to my friends, my precious people.</p>
<p>You should know what I look like, nowadays. I’ve included a picture, probably
not the first you’ve seen, though, as I’m sure you’ll have talked with my
fellows on previous stops. But if you see smaller versions of me around,
don’t blink — say hi. I’ve at last managed to acquire some decent tea.</p>
<p>You will not find any further note. Don’t try. Leave this to be my final one.
I have been following your progress, lately, as your search coincided with
my travels. This last stash should satisfy you for a little while, Otto,
and then it’s your turn. A millennium of research and travel, two centuries
of chase. Go forth and make it all your own, from now on. And thank you.</p>
<p>— Found in the Rehua, a citadel-station orbiting Antares, 9570 CE.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="regulus-notes-and-author-commentary"><a class="header" href="#regulus-notes-and-author-commentary">Regulus (notes and author commentary)</a></h1>
<p>The story of the narrator starts one or two centuries beyond our present time.
It is in accordance of my own beliefs that this kind of technology (to be able
to live a long time, if not forever, and to have decent space travel methods,
to start with) will be available and ready in our world, in reality, at most
around this kind of timeframe. From there, the narrator says they wasted a
century before getting to work, and that this note was written after “three
score centuries” or 6000 years, have passed. So the story begins at least after
8316 CE. The last note puts it at 8570 CE, but durations are purposefully left
fuzzy to allow for wording and the difficulty to measure time accurately over
space travel, FTL, and times beyond anything we, humans of the 21st century,
can reasonably imagine.</p>
<p>The story for the “reader,” who is not the reader of this short, but a
character named Otto who finds this note and then begins a search for the
narrator (presumably to tell them how Earth is?), begins in 9387 CE. The search
lasts 200 years, during which the narrator leads Otto on a merry chase of
stashes of research and notes across the Universe. We, the reader of the short,
only get to read a few of the notes, as hinted in the Nyctimene entry;
furthermore, there are also the stacks of research results and notes provided
along each entry; it would not be realistic for just those few clues contained
in the entries to be sufficient to find the next one. But those ones put
together have an interesting thread.</p>
<p>The Sechura desert is better known as the place where the Nazca lines are. The
Owlman is a Nazca figure representing a person with an owl’s face, arm raised up.</p>
<p>ATHENA is an actual X-Ray space telescope that is being built and will be
launched in a few years. ATHENA ΑΘΕ is probably one of its far, far successor.
This is happening 62–72 centuries in the future, after all. The ATHENA
telescope, ours, is going to be in L2 orbit; obviously this latter one, version
ΑΘΕ, stayed there, too. “ΑΘΕ” was an inscription on Athenian drachmas in
Ancient Greece, accompanied by a depiction of an owl.</p>
<p>The Phæthontis quadrangle is an area of Mars. Phaeton was a demigod who, one
day, drove the Sun’s carriage across the skies. “as dusk falls” is a reference
to the philosopher Hegel, who noted that “the owl of Minerva spreads its wings
only with the falling of the dusk.” Jiang Maze’s name does not mean anything
and is not particularly significant; I pulled it from a box of tea and a poster
in my brother’s room. Jiang is the family name. They use the pronoun “they” as
written in the text. Speaking of pronouns, notice how none of the characters
have a defined gender? The two names, Jiang and Otto, are neutral in this
regard. What gender did you give the characters, in your mind, while reading?</p>
<p>2150 Nyctimene is an asteroid (or minor planet, to be precise) in our solar
system, which I have dubbed Sol system in this short, discovered in 1977 bla
bla bla, none of that is relevant.</p>
<p>It’s located quite a ways from Earth, on an orbit inclined from the elliptic;
in my story, that provides a place that is accessible from other planets by
conventional propulsion, and then brings your vessel away from the influence
and business of the main plane of our system, so that you may engage your FTL
without causing nor getting undue interference.</p>
<p>To get back to the reference thread, Nyctimene was the daughter of Epopeus,
King of Lespos. Pursued by her father, she was rescued by Athena who turned her
into an owl, the very owl depicted on the drachmas.</p>
<p>The Owl of Athena, or the Owl of Minerva, as called by the Romans, was, by the
way, a symbol of knowledge and study.</p>
<p>Dagon is the name of an exoplanet orbiting the star Fomalhaut. It is situated
within an immense disc of debris floating around the star. Photos of that disc
of debris and the star show a distinctly fuzzier band: a dust ring. A view from
the side of that disc makes it look elliptical. All in all, from here, it kinda
looks like an eye, with a massive ball of fire in the middle of it. Fomalhaut
is about twice as large as the sun.</p>
<p>For the imagery, we have to go back to Epopeus: his name came from ἔποψ, better
known as the hoopoe, also nicknamed “the watcher.” Then we abandon Greek
mythology and go to the Persians, to whom the star was one of the four “Royal
stars,” and more precisely, was named Hastorang, of the winter solstice, “the
Watcher of the North.” (That’s not meant as a reference to a very popular TV
series of the moment, it’s entirely coincidence. I needed a star with a planet
that referred to the Nyctimene somehow, and I’d already made plans for two
other Royal stars.)</p>
<p>The planet is located near that dust ring mentioned before, which completes the
explanation for the Eye of Sauron mention. The shielded structure is because
the planet is moving through the disc of debris, impacts are frequent, so a
shield is necessary; and in turn, the shield would generate a sky of continuous
showers of burning meteor remains (the shield would destroy said meteors
instead of bouncing them or repelling them; I felt that was more realistic
compared to the fairly fantastic shields present in some other space-bound
sci-fi.) Finally, the planet has a very long orbit, spanning 2000 years.</p>
<p>Aldebaran is another of the Royal stars. Its current name means “The Follower,”
in Arabic. In Hindu, it is called “the mansion Rohini.” For the location in
this story, I went with a reference to the excellent BD “Les Mondes
d’Aldébaran,” which inspired me during my teenage years. One of the first
scenes in that story depicts a very long and beautiful beach, on the planet
Aldébaran-4, fourth and only livable planet in the Aldebaran system.</p>
<p>Antares is also a Royal star. It’s a red supergiant nearly 900 times the size
of the sun. In Ancient Greece, the citadel or acropolis of a city-state
contained its royal palace. Antares has had various names in history, like:
“the Lord of the Seed,” “The King,” “Jyeshthā” (“the Eldest”). In Māori, it is
called “Rehua” and regarded as the chief of all the stars.</p>
<p>The title, Regulus, refers to the fourth and last Royal star, and perhaps the
next destination of the narrator, who knows.</p>

<p>When the ship of my early childhood approached the land of life, knowledge is
what I saw and what I started seeking. My journey began on the coast, where I
learned to walk, and then I looked up, and saw all that I could climb. The slope
was steep, the rock slippery, the path barely walked. And when I reached up to
the summit I had glimpsed as a child, I found that it had merely been the place
where earth meets the bottom of the clouds, and that my mountain continued
upwards, and that its true summit I could never see at all.</p>
<p>But this did not discourage me.</p>
<p>And as I turned around and gazed over all I could see from here, and all that I
had achieved in this climb, I knew that I would continue, forever if need be, in

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blue-orange-cocktail"><a class="header" href="#blue-orange-cocktail">Blue Orange cocktail</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ice a glass.</strong>
Use large ice cubes if you have some; the ice is not consumed here, it’s used to cool the drink and keep it ice-cold while it’s drunk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Half a teaspoon of salt.</strong>
I prefer coarse salt, or possibly fleur de sel if I have some to spare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One teaspoon of granulated sugar.</strong>
Simple syrup can also work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Half a shot lime juice.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One shot Cointreau.</strong>
I say one shot because it’s fairly easy to remember and make with a standard jigger but really the drink benefits from a bit less Cointreu, so you can do instead:
<strong>half a shot Cointreau and a quarter shot overproof rum agricole</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Half a shot orange blossom water.</strong>
Again this is the “easy” measure, but it should be a bit less than the lime to not be overpowering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top with soda water.</strong>
Or still, as one likes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stir once.</strong>
You want to lightly distribute the flavours but not homogenise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Garnish with violet flowers.</strong>
Or mint, that works too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Drink from the top down (no straws).
If you use a straw you’ll get the salt immediately, but you don’t want that until the end, as the cocktail’s final note.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="semi-steamed-pasta"><a class="header" href="#semi-steamed-pasta">Semi-steamed Pasta</a></h1>
<p>This is my go-to when I don’t want to cook but need to eat, or when I need
a pasta base for something else but no space on the stove. You can add a
<em>bouillon cube</em> or OWO or similar to the water if you want to use it
afterwards to make a sauce: it will then infuse flavour into the pasta.</p>
<p>N.B. This is a one-portion recipe. However, you can probably swing two smaller
portions of pasta. You don’t want to fill the basket more than 2/3rds at the most:
pasta increases in size as it cooks, and will either overflow or not cook well.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients-1"><a class="header" href="#ingredients-1">Ingredients</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>1 portion of Pasta</li>
<li>1L Water</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method-1"><a class="header" href="#method-1">Method</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Fill the bowl to the 1L mark with cold water. You can use just-boiled water: remove 9 minutes from the time.</li>
<li>Insert the steam basket. The water should come about 1cm above the bottom of the basket.</li>
<li>Measure one portion of the pasta of your choice, and drop it into the basket.</li>
<li>Add half a teaspoon of salt on top. You can also season with pepper or other spices.</li>
<li>Set at Varoma/steam temperature, <strong>22 minutes</strong>, <strong>speed 1</strong>, <strong>cap off</strong>.</li>
<li>Once it’s done, use the spatulla tool’s hook to remove the basket, and serve.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="explanation"><a class="header" href="#explanation">Explanation</a></h2>
<p>The water, when boiling, takes significantly more space due to the bubbles, and this
is exarcerbated by the many nucleation sites on the basket and the pasta, as well as
the increased emulsivity of pasta water. In the thermomix’s constrained bowl, that
translates into a much-raised water level. When the water is below 100℃, that
doesn’t happen, so the pasta is untouched (except for the bottom 1cm). Once it starts
boiling, the water covers the pasta and cooks it. That way you preserve the requirement
to only add pasta to boiling water, without having a manual step in the middle.</p>
<p>A litre of water takes about 8-9 minutes to get to boiling in the Thermomix. Using
a kettle to boil the water is faster, but adds a step; additionally, the bowl being
much colder than the water means it takes about a minute to start boiling again.</p>
<p>When the timer stops, so does the heat, and thus so does the boil. During cooking,
about 300mL of water evaporate, so when it’s done, all the water receeds below the
basket, essentially auto-draining the pasta. Finally, the pasta’s starch also drains
off immediately, so the pasta won’t stick together (as much) if left alone for a bit
(for example, if you’re cooking a sauce to go with it). And the starched water left
is extra-concentrated, due to cooking with so little water: perfect to add to a sauce.</p>
<h2 id="extra"><a class="header" href="#extra">Extra</a></h2>
<p>You can add one or two eggs, whole, on top of the pasta. They will hard-boil while cooking.</p>
<p>You can try adding other things in, but beware! If what you add significantly changes how the water
behaves when boiling, you can end up undercooking or overflowing. For example, oil or butter result
in severely decreased boil volume, and the water won’t cover all the pasta, so only the bottom tier
will cook.</p>

<p>A Discord middleware for writing Discord bots.</p>
<p>The principle is to eat the Discord API and output it as structured requests to a local HTTP server.
The server can then respond, generating events in return that are translated and sent back up to
Discord. The advantage lies in using the HTTP server stack, which means notably that the Accord
target could be an nginx server, which could then direct different requests to different backends,
add caching, load-balancing, a/b and canary deployments, etc… without having to write that common
code (as it’s built in to nginx).</p>
<p>Furthermore, client implementations become restartable with no downtime, it’s possible to write
parts of servers in different languages and stacks, and everything speaks an extremely common
protocol, which means there are <em>tonnes</em> of tooling.</p>

<p>The concept of having an intermediary gateway worked well. The advantages in regard to routing,
tooling, load-balancing, and having a common stack were borne out. However, HTTP is the wrong medium
for this. Particularly missing is bidirectionality, especially in the form of requests initiated on
the “client” / bot side, rather than always responding to events from Discord.</p>
<p>Further, the headers / body data dichotomy is awkward. Headers are available for proxies to route
with, but are a flat, untyped list of key-values. Information may be duplicated. It’s also hard to
establish compatibility.</p>
<p>A future exploration space with much of the same advantages but resolving the issue of bidi and
helping with the data aspect could be to use gRPC instead of plain HTTP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>August 2022 <strong>Work in progress</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background-2"><a class="header" href="#background-2">Background</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1548245821426401282">I got interested</a> in <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/06/27/new-optical-device-help-solar-arrays-focus-light-even-clouds/">a Stanford article</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-018-0015-4">a Nature paper</a> that used a device
called an AGILE (Axially Graded Index LEns) to enhance solar panels. An AGILE is a complex bit of
glass-like plastic that resembles an upside-down truncated cone or pyramid.</p>
<p>I’ll quickly summarise the papers:</p>
<p>The principle is pretty simple: the pyramid is made of a series of horizontal layers with increasing
refractive indices going deeper (towards the narrow end), and the sloped sides are coated with a
reflective material. Any light that enters the wide top of the device is curved towards the bottom
by the successive layers, and reflecting against the sides only increases the effect due to the
angle. In the end, all light that enters the top of the AGILE at any angle will exit at the bottom.</p>
<p>Due to the angle, the top surface is larger than the bottom, which means that light is effectively
concentrated. At a wild guess, if the top surface is four times the bottom, then the light will be
four time concentrated on average.</p>
<p>The AGILE also concentrates input light that arrives at any angle and curves it such that it
exits the lens at angles that are bound by the angles of the device.</p>
<p>These properties make AGILEs an attractive solution for increasing the cost-effectiveness of solar
panels: not only can the active surface (the part actually covered in photovoltaics) be reduced
compared to the solar panel’s total surface, but the panel can operate at much wider input angles,
which is a well-known issue with solar installations, and it does so with a static and completely
passive device that doesn’t require much overhead in terms of space.</p>
<h2 id="building-one"><a class="header" href="#building-one">Building one</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://snfexfab.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj8726/f/sections/diplayfiles/ee412_finalreport-gradedindex.pdf">This paper</a> describes how to build an AGILE:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain a set of optical (i.e. extremely clear) resins that can be cured with UV and have a range
of refractive indices (RI) when cured. Remember this bit.</li>
<li>Build a mould: a 3D printer does the trick here, plus some post-processing (sanding) to smooth
the sides. The researchers seem to have directly built the negative, but it might be easier for
repeatability and ease of demoulding to print the positive and make a silicon mould.</li>
<li>Pour a layer of the highest RI resin.</li>
<li>Cure it with a UV lamp.</li>
<li>Repeat 3–4 with decreasing RI resins.</li>
<li>Demould the pyramid, finish the edges.</li>
<li>Coat the angled sides with a reflective layer. It might be sufficient to spray paint a high
concentration mixture of silver pigment powder and acrylic base, or a deposition process could be
used with silver nitrate.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, that’s pretty simple, and it sounds doable in DIY, right?</p>
<p>Step one, obtain a set of optical resins, like, uhhh, <a href="https://www.norlandproducts.com/adhchart.html">these ones</a>. Wait, what’s the price
of those? Uhhh $230 USD per pound, so about $500 USD per kilogram. And you’d need at least five, so
for a kg of each that will come to a shiny $2500 USD just to get started. I can’t imagine we’d need
<em>less</em> than about a kilo total per panel, given some maths that I’ll leave to reader discretion, so
at a glance we’re looking at a cool $500 USD per ~standard two square metre solar panel. Plus the
cost of the photovoltaics and frame and so on, but that’s decently cheap, on the range of $100 USD.</p>
<p>So we’re looking at a device that <em>at least quintuples</em> the cost of a solar panel, just to get some
better utilisation in the mornings and evenings. Not very cost effective, <em>and</em> prohibitive for DIY.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-materials"><a class="header" href="#alternative-materials">Alternative materials</a></h2>
<p>Can we find alternative materials that are much cheaper and would allow us to control their RI?
Well, solids are a no. Resins are it, and finding optical-grade resins with precise RIs… we’re
back at square one. Glasses are a no-go. Diamond and other lattices or crystals are also exorbitant.</p>
<p>What about liquids? No, hear me out.</p>
<p>Glycerol (also called glycerine) is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol">a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting
and non-toxic</a>.” It’s also miscible in water. And it has a RI of 1.46. Water, by the
by, has a RI of 1.33.</p>
<p>Mixing glycerol and water at varying ratios <em>changes the RI of the mixture</em> in between these two
extremes. Further, adding a water-soluble compound, like sugar or salt, may <em>increase</em> the RI, for
some fine tuning.</p>
<p>So, if we can create water-glycerol compounds at precise ratios, we can possibly get a set of
colorless odorless non-toxic liquids that have a range of RI, from 1.33 to 1.46.</p>
<p>We can then layer these liquids, partitioned by much thinner pieces of a strong plastic, like
acrylic which has a higher RI at 1.50, but the thickness difference should make that negligible. The
bottom of this new AGILE can then be a thicker bit of acrylic, for the final step at 1.50.</p>
<p>What’s the cost of glycerol? <a href="https://www.purenature.co.nz/products/vegetable-glycerine-refined-palm-free?_pos=3&amp;_sid=dc0f74cf3&amp;_ss=r">Less than $10 USD per kg</a>. Acrylic sheeting is about $20
USD per square metre depending on thickness and retailer. Water will need to be pure or distilled,
and that costs about $0.50 USD per litre.</p>
<p>Pro: we’re looking at something about 40 times cheaper than with resins.</p>
<p>Con: it sounds absolutely bonkers.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries"><a class="header" href="#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a></h2>
<p>We need to do a few things before we can actually get to the hands on bit:</p>
<h3 id="build-or-obtain-some-kind-of-rig-or-tool-to-measure-ri"><a class="header" href="#build-or-obtain-some-kind-of-rig-or-tool-to-measure-ri">Build or obtain some kind of rig or tool to measure RI</a></h3>
<p>I… thought this was going to be hard, but actually refractometres are very common! Turns out
they’re used a lot in a (somewhat dodgy-sounding tbh, how would you control for other effects by
contaminants?) practice to measure the amount of sugar in a solution, like fruit juices, or
conversely the amount of water in a sugary liquid, like honey. And apparently also for alcohol in
wines and beer. Again, I’m a bit concerned here, in many wines and some beers you’d have both
alcohol and sugar, surely that would be hard to distinguish? But whatever, I don’t know enough about
it.</p>
<p>For my uses, though: an analog refractometre is about $20, and a digital one around $150. Digital
ones are much more precise, but finding one that has both the required range <em>and</em> shows the RI
value instead of some derived specialised unit like Brix was quite tough! I bought both an analog
and a digital one; after this project I’m sure I can find other uses, and mum <em>does</em> keep bees, so.</p>
<h3 id="find-some-photovoltaic-cells-not-entire-panels-and-rig-at-least-one-to-measure-output-current"><a class="header" href="#find-some-photovoltaic-cells-not-entire-panels-and-rig-at-least-one-to-measure-output-current">Find some photovoltaic cells (not entire panels) and rig at least one to measure output current</a></h3>
<p>Finding them is easy: AliExpress has a selection, and I picked <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000511987311.html">one</a>.</p>
<p>I picked them on a combination of price, stated power output, and shape. 52mm squares sounds pretty
good to me, it will let me work at the macro level. The research cited above worked at much smaller
sizes, with AGILEs on the order of 10mm wide or less. I was concerned about this because finding
cells that tiny is tougher, and the wiring will get annoying, but most importantly the experimental
setup seen in one of these papers looked to me like the agile didn’t cover the entire cell. That
felt like a waste of some of the cell, and could even affect measurements.</p>
<p>So anyway, I bought a stack of cells, and I’m awaiting them. I’ll be measuring output current with
my regular ampmeter.</p>
<h3 id="figure-out-what-the-optimal-size-of-the-device-and-the-number-ris-and-thicknesses-of-the-layers-is"><a class="header" href="#figure-out-what-the-optimal-size-of-the-device-and-the-number-ris-and-thicknesses-of-the-layers-is">Figure out what the optimal size of the device and the number, RIs, and thicknesses of the layers is</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the bit you’re here for. The rest of the article will be updated when I make
progress on the physical construction of the object.</p>
<p>I want not only to construct an AGILE, but I want to construct the <em>best</em> AGILE I can with my
constraints. To do that, I’m going to define a model for simulation, parametrise it, assign a score
to a parameter set, and then run an exhaustive search on the parameter space, to finally rank and
find the ideal AGILE I can make.</p>
<p>“Exhaustive? That’s gonna take forever!”</p>
<p>Well, I’ll use Rust for the actual compute, and I’m going to start by strictly defining the model to
both get an idea of the possibility space and to figure out how many calculations I’ll need to do,
as well as a simple estimate of how long it will take.</p>
<h4 id="the-model"><a class="header" href="#the-model">The model</a></h4>
<p>So, I’m going to take the AGILE object, and I’m going to cut a section down the middle:</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./scad-section-preview.png" alt="a 3D render of the pyramid with a sectioning plane down the middle" /></p>
<p>Which will look like this in 2D:</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./section-bare.png" alt="that section drawn on a grid, with points named A through D starting on the top left and going clockwise" /></p>
<p>On that top surface, in the diagram labelled A–B, I’m going to define a series of entry points at
regular intervals starting from one end (A) to the other (B). The distance from the last point to
the end will not always be an exact interval, of course. In the below diagram I’m showing points
every 10 units, but in the actual simulation I’m going to go with every 1mm for extra precision.</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./section-dotted.png" alt="the same diagram but with nineteen points E through M spread out on the top segment" /></p>
<p>From each of these points I’m going to define a set of angles of incidence. Again in the diagram I’m
showing only a few angles on a few points for clarity, but in the simulation I’ll go with integer
angles from 1° to 179° inclusive, except at the two extremes where it doesn’t make sense, and the
range will be bound a little tighter.</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./section-angles.png" alt="the same diagram but three points have many lines going at various angles from them and extending upwards" /></p>
<p>For each of these angles at each of these points, I’ll compute the path the ray of light takes
inside the lens, where it exits, and at what angle. Then, over the the entire set of rays of a
particular parametrised AGILE, I’ll calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proportion of rays that exit at the bottom (higher is better)</li>
<li>the average exit angle for those that exit at the bottom (closer to vertical is better)</li>
<li>the length of the path the light takes inside the lens (lower is better)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these three measures, weighted in that order, will produce a single score for any given
parameter set. Getting that score will mean computing 178 (entry angles) × 105 (entry points) rays
given a fixed 104mm top width for the section, so at most 18690 rays per param set.</p>
<h4 id="model-parameters"><a class="header" href="#model-parameters">Model parameters</a></h4>
<p>So, the way the AGILE is going to be constructed, it’s going to be a laminate of thinner
<em>partitions</em>, made of acrylic, and thicker <em>layers</em>, which are filled with a liquid. The top and
bottom will be partitions, and there will be a partition in between each layer.</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./section-layered.png" alt="the diagram without the entry points and incidence lines but with the partitions and layers as described" /></p>
<p>The thickness of the partitions is the same for all, and for model simplicity I’ll say that the
thickness of the layers is also the same through the AGILE. If the model works out to be
sufficiently fast, these could be made to vary, to possibly get more options or better optimisation.</p>
<p>The RI of each layer will be a variable. For model simplicity I won’t constrain the layers to be in
increasing RI top to bottom; that’s likely what it will work out to anyway but maybe there will be
some surprising behaviour coming out of that.</p>
<p>The number of layers will also be a variable.</p>
<p>The width of the bottom is set to 52mm because that’s the size of the PV cell tiles I’ve bought. I’m
going to set that the top width be 104mm, exactly twice, for now. Making it a variable increases the
possibility space a lot; for now I’ll keep it fixed.</p>
<p>With all this, the height of the pyramid will be determined entirely by the variables above.</p>
<p>The variable set will be described like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct ParamSet {
  /// RI of the layers
  ///
  /// This specifies both the _amount_ of layers (number of elements in
  /// the slice) and the _refractive index_ of each.
  layers_ri: &amp;[f64],

  /// Thickness of each layer in tenths of mm
  layers_thickness: u32,

  /// Thickness of each partition in tenths of mm
  partitions_thickness: u32,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>On top of this, there will also be some bounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of layers will be minimum 2, maximum 10. Two is the minimum useful, ten is arbitrary.</li>
<li>The thickness of partitions will be minimum 0.2mm, maximum 3mm, from the set <code>0.2mm</code>, <code>0.4mm</code>,
<code>0.6mm</code>, <code>0.8mm</code>, <code>1.0mm</code>, <code>1.2mm</code>, <code>1.5mm</code>, <code>2.0mm</code>, <code>3.0mm</code>. These are supply constraints, save
for the maximum which is arbitrary.</li>
<li>The thickness of layers will be minimum 3mm, maximum 28.6mm, in increments of 0.1mm. The bounds are
arbitrary on a general gut feel of what will be useful; the increment is the precision of a 3D
printer. The range is chosen so it fits in a <code>u8</code>.</li>
<li>The refractive indices will be minimum 1.33, maximum 1.50, in increments of 0.01. I don’t yet know
if it will be possible to measure or control RI to that precision, but it seems more likely than
0.001. The minimum is water (1.333), the maximum is acrylic (1.50): we could totally have a layer
that it entirely acrylic. RIs between 1.46 (pure glycerol) and 1.50 are yet unknown if they are
achievable (with additives?) but it would be easier to <em>exclude</em> results with these values rather
than not generate them in the first place and then find out we could have.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to finish our estimate and get onto the modelling work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of layers: 8 possibilities</li>
<li>Thickness of layers: 256</li>
<li>Thickness of partitions: 9</li>
<li>Refractive indices: 17 increments per layer, so 17×10=170 worst case</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibility space is thus at most 8×256×9×170 = <strong>3 133 440</strong>.</p>
<p>Multiplied by the amount of rays to compute for each param set, we need to perform about 60 billion
ray computes, or about 2 trillion individual refraction and reflection calculations.</p>
<p>Welp, that’s a lot. Gotta go fast!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not 17 <em>times</em> 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh? Oh. Oh no.</p>
<p>It’s 17 possibilities, in 10 boxes. Oh no. It’s 17 <strong>to the power of 10</strong>.</p>
<p>(Actually, it’s 17¹+17²+17³+… 17¹⁰ but that’s only marginally larger than 17¹⁰.)</p>
<p>That makes the possibility space about, uhhh, <strong>39 481 224 546 373 632</strong>? 39 quadrillions?
I’m not super loving it.</p>
<h4 id="evolving-past-this"><a class="header" href="#evolving-past-this">Evolving past this</a></h4>
<p>Alright, so, an exhaustive search is firmly out. What else is out there?</p>
<p>Well, this entire project is for fun, and I’ve always wanted to play around
with genetic algorithms. They just sound so neat! This seems like the perfect
pretext.</p>
<p>The first interesting crate I find is <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/genevo">genevo</a>. It looks complete and flexible.
Let’s try it out.</p>
<p><img src="technical/agile/./one-eternity-later.jpg" alt="“one eternity later” (the spongebob meme)" /></p>
<p>Implementing the genetic algorithm machinery with genevo was very soothing, really. Just keep
plugging at it until the thing compiles. A very Rusty afternoon.</p>
<p>However, I come to running it and I find that at the start of the process, I defined my fitness
function like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn fitness_of(&amp;self, params: &amp;ParamSet) -&gt; u64 {
  raytrace(*params).summarise()
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>What does that summarise function do? Well, it just summarises Performance:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub struct Performance {
	/// Proportion of rays that exit at the bottom.
	///
	/// Calculated as {bottom exit rays} * u32::MAX / {total rays}.
	///
	/// Higher is better.
	pub exit_ratio: u32,

	/// Average of exit angles (to the normal) for rays that exit at the bottom.
	///
	/// In 10000th Angle.
	///
	/// Lower is better.
	pub exit_angle: u32,

	/// Total distance light travels inside the lens.
	///
	/// In micrometres.
	///
	/// Lower is better.
	pub light_travel: u32,
}

impl Performance {
	pub fn summarise(self) -&gt; u64 {
		let one = self.exit_ratio as u64;
		let two = u32::MAX.saturating_sub(self.exit_angle) as u64;
		let three = u32::MAX.saturating_sub(self.light_travel) as u64;

		one * 10 + two * 5 + three
	}
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And how do I <em>get</em> a Performance? Ah:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub fn raytrace(params: ParamSet) -&gt; Performance {

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4 id="raytracing-but-like-the-hard-way"><a class="header" href="#raytracing-but-like-the-hard-way">Raytracing. But like, the hard way.</a></h4>
<p>I barely know enough about it to know that the activity is called raytracing, and that it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(physics)">not the
3D graphics kind of raytracing</a>. Something that’s mentioned pretty early on is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell&#x27;s_equations">Maxwell’s equations</a>, which is an intolerable amount of maths, fuck that.</p>
<p>No, failing to find any physics raytracing crates, I’m going to use good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell&#x27;s_law">the laws of
refraction</a> and the law of reflection. Very simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refraction: <code>sin(input) / sin(output) == ri(output) / ri(input)</code></li>
<li>Critical input angle: <code>arcsin(ri(output)/ri(input))</code>, where the output is always 90°</li>
<li>Total internal reflection: when the input angle is higher than the critical angle</li>
<li>Reflection: output angle == input angle, but staying on the same side</li>
</ul>
<p>All angles are to the <em>normal</em>, that is the perpendicular to the plane upon which the ray is
reflecting or through which it is refracting. (If it’s not a plane it’s perpendicular to the tangent
at that point, but in my model everything is planes, so idgaf.)</p>
<p>If you’ve done high school physics, you probably remember this.</p>
<p>Coding up these things is pretty easy. The hard bit is figuring out where a ray <em>is</em> in the model,
what boundary it will be intersecting with <em>next</em>, at what angle, and at what position.</p>
<p>At first I thought, you know what, I’ll do it with a turtle. I’ll advance my ray a bit, I’ll take
note of what I passed through, and</p>
<p>wait, how will I know I’ve passed something <em>through</em>?</p>
<p>and I basically got stuck there.</p>

<p>Adorning my car with a line of rainbow.</p>
<p>The original idea was to add a decoration that would distract from the various scratches and DIY
repairs on my car. I started by calculating the length I’d need, then designing and ordering about
five metres of rainbow “bumper” stickers in 30cm lengths. Then I mocked up the shape of the line
with masking tape, and sat on it for a few days. In the end I went with a diagonal line rather than
horizontal. It needed lots of adjustments to <em>look</em> straight from a distance, while dealing with the
reality of curved surfaces. Once I received the stickers, careful application took three afternoons.</p>

<h2 id="pitch-17"><a class="header" href="#pitch-17">Pitch</a></h2>
<p>A new library for interned path segments and paths with structural sharing.</p>
<p>String interning is actually a few different programming techniques, which can go from static string
interning, where a bunch of strings that will be used by the application are constants — generally
this is on a larger and more systematic scale than defining a bunch of consts — to language-level
(or VM-level) interning, like Ruby symbols which only exist once in the program, to fully-dynamic
interning with a little runtime.</p>
<p>IntPath is that last one.</p>
<p>Or rather, <em>IntSeg</em> is that last one. IntSeg is based on a global concurrent hash map, which is
initialised on program start. An IntSeg, an interned (path) segment, is an OsString that is stored
uniquely but weakly inside the map, and where every “actual” copy is actually a strong pointer to
that interned value. So every segment is only stored once, no matter where it’s created or accessed
from, and unused segments take up no (actually some, but very little) space.</p>
<p>Then <em>IntPaths</em> are built on top of that as, essentially, a <code>Vec&lt;IntSeg&gt;</code>. That makes paths <code>/a/b/c</code>
and <code>/a/b/d</code> use up only 4 path segments, instead of six. And 100 absolute paths with a common
prefix of 10 segments and a unique suffix of 1 segment will only use 110 segments total.
Additionally, segments don’t care about their position in the string, so the path <code>/a/a/a/a/a</code> uses
one segment.</p>
<p>There’s more, but that’s the general idea.</p>

<p>My house key is uncopyable by local locksmiths. I tried to make my own.</p>
<p>I experimented using epoxy casting in silicon moulds. In the end it wasn’t strong enough for daily
use, but I learned lots and even managed to produce something okay.</p>
<p>Then I envisioned trying metal casting. I was very much not doing my own metal casting, thank you.
Instead the idea was to hire a foundry for a very small run of a very small piece. From cursory
research, I ideally wanted to cast some copies in beeswax, send that to a foundry that can pour
Nickel Silver (or brass as a fallback), and then get my keys!</p>
<p>In the end, I ordered key blanks that matched my key as best I could tell, and convinced a local
locksmith to do a special cut.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fairly clear or transparent (for aesthetics)</li>
<li>Edible / non-toxic</li>
<li>Doesn’t stink!</li>

<p>The “long shelf life” requirement basically reduces the possibility set to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mineral oil (petroleum, colorless, odorless, non-edible, but not touch-toxic, quite cheap)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_oil">Ben oil</a> (golden, edible, fairly soft smell, 200C smoke

it portable and safe from spills (not permanently glued, with a rubber seal or something), so it
can sit on the topside of the desk looking all cool!</p>
<ul>
<li>Base: solid wood (Macrocarpa)</li>
<li>Glass: 3mm acrylic. This puts a further thermal restriction as it will melt at 80°C</li>
<li>Haven’t decided for the back. If I can find a large extruded alu heat sink like plate, that would be ideal, but otherwise will probably reuse and machine some existing computer case steel</li>

<li>It’s fanless, but not only that, it’s the only PSU I found which was completely enclosed without a grate. It’s not waterproof or anything, I’m not gonna go stick it in oil, but it looks really good, certainly good enough to sit outside the case</li>

<p>The idea so far is to track both what I want to read, what I’m reading, following, etc, all with a

<p>An everything-encrypted database and service of reasons for actions on twitter.</p>
<p>This is both about this frustration with not having reasons for following, or blocking, or not
following, or muting, etc… accounts on Twitter, and a challenge to design and write a service with
the most amount of encryption while still being able to offer something that works.</p>
<p>Really, the philosophy is that I don’t want to be able, as an admin operator, to read any of the
reasons, or see any of the people affected by the reasons, or even, if possible, access the social
media usernames of the people using the service, at least not without some willful modifications to
the service, or a trace on the process, something like that.</p>
<p>Someone obtaining an entire copy of the database should not be able to determine anything beyond the
number of users, and the number of reasons. Someone otaining that plus either the source or the
binary of the service should also have that same amount of access. That means layering and chaining,
and careful design thought, especially as putting all user data in one encrypted blob is not going
to work efficiently with potentially tens or hundred of thousands of reasons per.</p>
<p>Making data queryable without looking inside is an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>A deploy tool / experiment using Btrfs volume archives.</p>
<p>The actual deploy tool is a client/server/agent suite with some neat features but aiming to be
extremely light on resources, at least compared to many other tools I’ve tried.</p>
<p>But the core underpinning, the main idea, comes from playing around with btrfs volumes/snapshots and
the export/import commands on the tool. Essentially you can ask for an export of a volume, and you
can ask for an export of a volume <em>based on another volume</em>, then on import, which can be on a
completely different filesystem/disk/machine, as long as you have that same base volume, you can
restore.</p>
<p>So you can have filesystem-level diff archives on demand, with no awareness from the application
being built/deployed, and everything is already in standard linux tools.</p>
<p>It “just” needs some wrapping and managing.</p>

<p>In December 2016 I decided to blog more, and the way I chose to achieve that was
to give general updates across everything I was doing on a regular basis. In
2017 I produced one such update every month, plus one at the end of the year.
However, this effort faltered as it went on, until I completely gave it up in
early 2020.</p>
<p>These monthly updates were, in a way, cheaper and more informal than writing
blog posts for projects, and more durable than tweets. Their contents are kind
of “micro updates” on software developing, planning, life updates, reading,
writing, other craft projects… all sorts.</p>

<p>Partly inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/neakitten/status/807192118103916545">txanatan’s weekly roundup</a> that just came out right now,
I’ve decided to start blogging a little bit more! The first thing I noticed
while opening my blog folder is how little I’ve done so in the past two years:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">2015-dec-01

</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! Exactly 10 posts, counting this one, for the entire 2015–2016
period… awful. So, a New Year’s resolution is to try to write more. But, you
see, I don’t believe in having New Year’s resolutions take effect in the <em>new</em>
year. That’s just asking for trouble. Instead, I spend the last month or so of
a year reflecting and figuring out what to do better, then <em>start implementing
the changes right then</em>. That way, all I have to do the next year is keep on
doing them, i.e. the hard part.</p>
<p>Last year, I took the decision to have my eyes fixed permanently around this
time, and then the big day happened early this year. Guess what: it’s been
great. (Okay, this time last year was also when I broke up with my then-SO, so
it wasn’t all happy times, but lemons, lemonade, etc.)</p>
<p>So, end-of-year resolutions, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I want to improve my accent/speech.</strong> I’ve identified that not being
confident with my English pronounciation is actually a fairly big source of
anxiety in accomplishing some tasks. I’m considered fluent, but I do have an
accent and sometimes that makes it hard for people to understand me,
especially if they’re not used to it or distracted or, and this is the
critical bit, when there’s no body language or lip reading to help me. That
is, I’m much better at speaking with people face to face than on the phone or
even over VoIP. <strong>So I’ve contacted a speech therapist.</strong> I don’t know yet
whether this is something that will actually happen, because it’s quite
dependent on the right specialist being here in Whangarei and having time in
their schedule, but I’m hoping something will be going on sometime next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I want to lose some weight and be more fit.</strong> I’m not, by any stretch of
the imagination, in very good physical shape. I’m not a total wreck; I can do
an hour of moderately strenuous activity and be fine about it. I do walk five
or ten kms every so often. In mostly flat country. With no weight on my
shoulders. Yeah, so not great. Recently I did about 3–4 hours of kayaking
down an estuary and back up, and it killed me. I did it, but for two days
afterwards I hurt so bad all over that it was keeping me awake. <strong>So I’ve
started hiking up the forest behind home.</strong> Twice a week, probably will be
increasing that as I go. It’s a 30-minute hike there and back with about 50m
altitude difference. It’s a start. My goal is to do the Tongariro Crossing
once again — I did it last in 2011, and it erupted since, so I’d like to see
how it changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I want to write more.</strong> Not only in this blog, but also fiction. I give a
fair push every year during the NaNoWriMo, but it’s not really my mode of
writing. I like to take my time, outline things, work out the direction and
the details and all the little back references into the story. I’ve got a few
outlines and a bunch of story starts. And I want to write monthly updates of
what I’ve been doing. Weekly is a bit short, given I do most of my
other-than-work stuff on weekends, but monthly could work. <strong>So I’ve started
this blog post.</strong> And I have that one story I think I really like on a front
burner. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, as to what I’ve been doing in the past month or so:</p>
<h2 id="notify-1"><a class="header" href="#notify-1">Notify</a></h2>
<p>I’ve released version 3 of my Notify library, and started planning for a next
big refactor. There’s a few features I’d really like to get in that require a
completely different architecture than is there right now, and I’d also like to
improve the testability of the entire thing. Notably, I’d like to be able to
use several backend APIs simultaneously, something that I believe would be
fairly unique among other notify libraries and tools. I’m also inspired by the
(general) way nftables is done: instead of providing interfaces that provide
what I think people want, allow them to write <em>filters</em> that are run in the
engine and allow them to get exactly what they mean without me having too large
an API surface.</p>
<p>But really, while I have interesting plans, I don’t have enough time to work on
it. It took me a full week to release 3.0.1 with some needed fixes. I’m
terribly grateful to the other contributors who’ve made this library much
stronger than it was originally. I had no idea, when I started, that this would
become my most starred project to date, <em>by far</em>. It’s been pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="conlang"><a class="header" href="#conlang">Conlang</a></h2>
<p>I’ve created a script that I now call “Legola”. It’s the latest iteration in my
efforts to create a script that can be read the same way no matter the
orientation or direction of the page. Consider latin script (the one you use
reading these words): put it upside down, right to left, or even mirror it and
it becomes much harder to read. Sure, you can train yourself to read in all
directions nonetheless, but still.</p>
<p>This time, I went for something extremely compact: a single glyph is an entire
word. It’s based on a line: it starts somewhere (this is clearly marked) and
then as you follow it it turns this way or that way, or encounters some
obstacles. A counter-clockwise turn is the sound ‘ey’. A clockwise turn is the
sound ‘oh’. Two turns one after the other is ‘ah’. A bar crossing the line is
the consonant ‘L’. Two small parallel strokes on either side of the line mark
the consonant ‘F’. And it goes on.</p>
<p>It’s inspired not just by my own previous efforts, but also by two other
constructed languages: the Kelen Ceremonial Interlace Alphabet, and Hangul
(better known as South Korean). Kelen’s provided the “line” concept, and Hangul
is I believe one of the only scripts that combine several subglyphs to form
larger glyphs <em>in 2D space</em>. I’ll do a longer blog post on it when I’m done
hammering it all out.</p>

<p>I’ve acquired a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, took out the Tessel 2 I’d ordered
and finally gotten a few months back, and have started on wiring them up
together with the intention of creating a gauge for our water tank, so we can
accurately and easily track our water levels. So far I’m stuck in the actual
detecting-the-signal phase, or is it the is-this-wiring-diagram-right phase? I
can’t recall.</p>

is an incredible-looking keyboard, carved out of solid wood, with an ergonomic
split configuration, individually-sculpted keycaps, and all the trimmings. It’s
a treat. I’ve been lusting over it for over a year, following their production
newsletter. I’ve finally decided just before the new year (the “deadline” in
the tweet refers to them giving away an extra keycap set if pre-ordered before
the end of 2016) that I deserve to spend a bit of money on myself, so let’s go.</p>
<p>They’re hoping for a delivery around Q1 2017, I’m hoping to have it before May.</p>

<p>Not for me, yet. But my brother is looking into an upgrade before starting his
second year at Uni (he got into med!) and was especially interested in the
Surface Pro. One hitch: they’re <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>We may have just found out a trick, though: by getting it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01606IDL0?tag=laptop-magazine-20&amp;th=1">through Amazon US</a>
and shipping it here, we save about $600 NZD off the in-NZ price, even if we
get it at the cheapest source here. We’re looking hard to see if there’s a
catch, but so far everything looks a-ok.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a Surface Pro…</p>
<h2 id="backup--sync"><a class="header" href="#backup--sync">Backup &amp; Sync</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been outlining and tentatively speccing out my “perfect” backup and sync
solution. I briefly toyed with making it closed-source (to start with) but no,
if anything comes out of it, it will be open-source just like everything else.</p>
<p>The ideas mostly come from missing a decent and modern syncing and backup
daemon for Linux <strong>and</strong> other platforms. Something fire-and-forget, quietly
working to provide the best it can without disrupting you. Something that can
efficiently protect against ransom/encryption worms. Something that can be
paused to save bandwidth yet still sync the most important things right now so
you can work collaboratively on mobile connections and not have last night’s
photos clog your upwards link. Or, even better, something that figures out that
you’re on a slow connection and automatically prioritises syncs and backups
without intervention at all.</p>
<p>Behind it, a library and utility that efficiently and correctly syncs a local
and a remote, as a daemon and not just a single invocation (because Rsync
already exists), that works on all major platforms, and completely handles that
state may change on either side during its run. More than that, a library that
does not mandate the actual transport or endpoints, so it can be used to power
sync engines for not only my “something” above, but also Google Drive, Dropbox,
etc third-party clients.</p>
<h2 id="rust"><a class="header" href="#rust">Rust</a></h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813691373643698176">released Cargo Watch 3.1.1</a>, a minor update to upgrade
dependencies, notably the Notify library to version 3. That brought event
debouncing, which should solve a few of the most common issues encountered.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cargo Watch has been more or less supplanted by <a href="https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec">watchexec</a>, which
I have to admit is a superior albeit more generic alternative. I’m debating
retiring Cargo Watch, and focusing instead wholly on Notify. That, or making
Cargo Watch into more of a development tool than it was, and integrating
features such as port and socket management as first-class features, perhaps
combining the essential functionality of Node’s <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon">nodemon</a> and Ruby’s <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a>
into a single tool for the Cargo/Rust ecosystem.</p>

<p>(This isn’t new this month, but I got a question about it the other day.)</p>
<p>Not sure where I encountered this, but it’s a Jack of Hearts. (In case you
can’t see, the title of this section is the Unicode symbol for that playing
card.) Think “Jack of all trades”. It means (apparently, and that’s how I use
it for me) “pan/bi-amorous and poly-amorous”.</p>
<h2 id="music"><a class="header" href="#music">Music</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t listen to anything new until the New Year, as is my habit. During the
year, all the music I like goes into a big playlist called “Sort”. Then at the
end of the year I pick a name for my yearly playlist based on stars (first one
was “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5wS0AZ6nQ5BUGt36jYbvo0">Level Orion</a>”, then came “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5zkHK8ynwd3NdiAbA7Q8lK">Rain Stars</a>”, “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5NtXFS8YFZtnDRvPNmKPOy">Llama Shepherd</a>”, and this
year’s “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/4ROxOg5BYFe4SXo8YLEXrR">Carrier of the Dawn</a>”), and go through the Sort playlist sequentially,
either discarding or sorting into the yearly playlist and/or any of the few
thematic playlists I maintain (“<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/15G3i15GTFluL6jgwj7f70">Music for Making</a>” for writing/coding music,
“Sing”, “Music Box” for songs I’d like to cover, etc).</p>
<p>This year the “Sort” playlist counted over 450 songs, and took me about two
weeks to go through. The “Carrier of the Dawn” playlist now numbers 224 tracks.</p>
<p>While last year my listening was dominated by <a href="https://www.blueman.com/">Blue Man Group</a>, <a href="http://www.eiffelnews.com/">Eiffel</a>, and
<a href="http://www.woodkid.com/">Woodkid</a>, this year I’ve enjoyed a lot of <a href="http://jinoki.net/">Jin Oki</a>, <a href="http://www.thomasbergersen.com/">Thomas Bergensen</a>, <a href="http://zero7.co.uk">Zero

Beethoven. Of course, the full list is much more varied than just these seven.</p>
<p>In the past 10 days I’ve started listening to new music again.</p>

<h2 id="writing"><a class="header" href="#writing">Writing</a></h2>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of my weekends writing a Star Wars fanfic. I’m going to finish
it before I publish, to avoid publishing and then abandoning it when I
eventually realise I’ve written myself into a corner. It’s completely outlined,
and I’ve got some willing and eager proofreaders waiting for it, so I have
hope.</p>
<p>I’ve already got ideas for a sequel; if there’s interest I might be
working on that for a while, too. The sequel will contain <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/822330577307086849">a certain ship</a>.</p>
<p>No title as of yet, working title of my file was SW:E:SI at the beginning of
the month, but what it stood for was already outdated by the time I got to the
middle of the outlining, so I changed it to the non-commital “Master Kylo”.
Maybe it will stay that.</p>
<h2 id="300-shorts"><a class="header" href="#300-shorts">300 Shorts</a></h2>
<p>I’ve moved my “300 Shorts” collection entirely to this blog, instead of its
previous home on Medium. I’ve also added an introductory post, which
additionally serves as a common ‘parent post’ for all the shorts, taking
advantage of my blog engine’s capabilities: it will add a link from each entry
to the main post, and add a list (with links) of all the entries onto that main
post.</p>
<p>I’ve also published two so-far-unpublished pieces from 2016 into this collection.
The first is a short poem written last year: <a href="updates/dated/2017/../../../fiction/poetry/unlit.html">Unlit</a>. The second is a sci-fi
story originally written for a contest: <a href="updates/dated/2017/../../../fiction/shorts/regulus.html">Regulus</a>. It is accompanied by a few
pages of <a href="updates/dated/2017/../../../fiction/shorts/regulus-notes.html">notes and commentary</a>.</p>
<h2 id="backup-and-sync"><a class="header" href="#backup-and-sync">Backup and Sync</a></h2>
<p>Discovered a very interesting paper, algorithm, and software: <a href="https://haneul.github.io/papers/metasync.pdf">MetaSync</a>. It
provides a sync utility that can store data across several services and even
replicate this data for maximum reliability and synchronisation speed. I have
yet to evaluate the solution in-depth for my needs, but it certainly sounds
promising.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the software is not quite as maintained nor modern as I
would wish it. For this reason, my next large Rust project will be to implement
the pPaxos algorithm, the core metasync library, a CLI frontend and a sync
Daemon, as well as some remote storage adapters (probably starting with
Dropbox, Google Drive, MEGASync), and some local storage middleware (selective
encryption, compression).</p>
<p>I’ll probably choose a different name, though, not only to avoid stepping on
toes, but also because I don’t quite believe “meta sync” to be a good
descriptor for what this does.</p>
<h2 id="hyperion"><a class="header" href="#hyperion">Hyperion</a></h2>
<p>After several years (at least four, but it gets fuzzy before then) of quiet
research and occasional thought, I finally got the last insight into my very own
algorithm for hypergraphs (and their somewhat-optimised subset hypermaps).</p>
<p>My hypergraphs are optimised for a specific query: “give me all the vertices of
all the edges that contain the given vertex.” Hyperion executes that for any
arbitrary vertex with the same time complexity as the underlying substrate. For
a HashMap, that’s O(1).</p>
<p>Hyperion is also fairly good at memory space: it incurs only a small fixed
overhead per-vertex and per-edge. Other implementations of bimaps, hypermaps, or
hypergraphs use about twice the amount of memory as is input into them.</p>
<p>Using Hyperion is mostly about thinking differently about some data. Once you
understand that you essentially have a structure which can store <em>associations</em>
of objects and then retrieve the entire association given <em>any value within</em>,
in constant time… once you really understand the idea and start being able to
apply it to problems, that’s when it becomes interesting.</p>
<p>Hyperion is not quite ready for publication, but the concept is finished and a
full description of its algorithms — for insert, for query, for modification —
is done in pseudocode. An initial implementation in Rust, some analysis, a few
measurements, and better documentation remain to be completed.</p>

<p>Currently going through a second round of detailed outlining, after changing

<h2 id="blograph"><a class="header" href="#blograph">Blograph</a></h2>
<p>The engine this blog runs on is a custom-built server designed and implemented
over three years ago when I tired at not having the options I needed, and just
decided to make it my way. However, I also didn’t touch it much in those three
years. Over time, some bugs were discovered, a few missing features exposed,
and one large element of the design was never actually used — while creating a
performance limiter nonetheless.</p>
<p>Also, I needed an exercise to get back into Rust.</p>
<p>So I did a blackbox reimplementation of my blog, plus a few missing features,
minus two obsolete ones. I made it a hybrid of Rust and JavaScript, using Neon
to bridge the two. I <a href="updates/dated/2017/../../../deprecated/outdated/lighting-up-rust-with-neon.html">blogged about some patterns</a> I encountered
when wrangling the Neon bindings.</p>
<p>The new version has upwards of 300 tests (170 on the Rust side, and more than
that on the JS side), sports a <strong>5x</strong> performance boost, has up-to-spec
CommonMark rendering and new footnote support, and is a lot more <em>consciously
designed</em> instead of haphazardly put together. It’s live; you’re reading this
article on an instance right now.</p>

<h2 id="rust-1"><a class="header" href="#rust-1">Rust</a></h2>
<p>I wrote down <a href="https://github.com/passcod/notify/issues/117">a massive design document</a> for Notify’s future, then
submitted it to the Rust Reddit community to hopefully get some comments and
reviews. The response was mostly positive, I think. However, actual
implementation will likely take a back seat for month to come, as I work on
other creative endeavours (see below).</p>
<p>I also published <a href="https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch/releases/tag/v4.0.0">version 4.0 of Cargo Watch</a>, following a
near-complete rewrite and finally resolving several long-standing bugs and
feature requests, including one or two that had been open for more than a year!</p>
<p>I also upgraded Cargo Watch’s supporting documents to <a href="https://github.com/WeAllJS/weallbehave">WeAllBehave</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/WeAllJS/weallcontribute">WeAllContribute</a>’s outstanding templates, adapting them slightly so

Almost? Almost. There was definitely <strong>one</strong> that I didn’t care for at all, and
maybe a couple others were merely <em>meh</em>. But overall? great stuff.</p>
<h2 id="that-star-wars-fanfiction-im-writing"><a class="header" href="#that-star-wars-fanfiction-im-writing">That Star Wars Fanfiction I’m Writing</a></h2>
<p>(The working title was “Master Kylo”, but things happened, and now Kylo Ren is a
minor character, so I’ll have to pick a <em>new</em> working title. I’m bad at these.)</p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/843336749388447744">tweeted an (intentionally) blurry photo</a> of a timeline I put up
on my whiteboard. That was a progress shot: its current state is quite a bit
more complete, but I also can’t show it because <em><strong>spoilers</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Black is what I’m using from Canon, boxed names are characters or organisations
I care about (or for context), and correspond to lines showing, by their
proximity, where people/orgs are in relation to others. Purple is the Alternate
Universe parts of my fic, the things that are not Canon. Yes, this fic is
multiple-points-of-departure.</p>
<p>You can’t see it because it’s so faint, but there’s also dates indicated. That
busy middle bit before the vertical line going upwards is the period between 5
and 28 ABY. The leftmost of the board starts at 19 BBY, i.e. the end of Episode
III, and the rightmost lines end around 34 ABY, i.e. Episode VII. I left a bit
of space after that for the actual action of my fic. It’s not to scale! There’s
some areas that are very expanded, and some where five years take as many
centimetres. I only have so much space.</p>
<p>I’m now aiming to have a solid detailed outline for Part 1 of the fic, covering
about 0 ABY until 33 ABY in various threads, as well as at least 15% (10-12k
words) of the material drafted out, for my birthday. That’s in a month or so,
and I already have about 4k words written down as of publish of this update.</p>
<p>The fic has shifted focus a few times during the last few months, and now as it
approaches its final (for now) plan it’s about the lives and events of several
characters in-between Episodes VI and VII. We’ll see a little of Luke and Leia
and Han, but it’s mostly about the Resistance and how it kept on fighting,
about a boy being kidnapped from a Sectors planet and finding a good head for
strategy and good company… only to lose it when his conscience calls him out,
leaving behind a troubled young man who has no idea what he’ll become. It’s
about an explorer keeping his faith even as he sees a dear friend withdraw from
the world (with good reason) and as he leaves a place that felt like home to
hide away, but who also cannot escape the call of discovery and curiosity. It’s
about a mysterious voice speaking on old frequencies bringing hope and tales
and unlikely help. It’s about a young woman in a hostile environment determined
to get out and make her mark on the world, and it’s about another determined to
stay put and survive where she is. It’s about the worlds continuing to turn
while you’re looking away.</p>
<p>What’s amusing is that the plot point that triggered the conception of this fic
is now a minor detail that will be used only two or three times. But it’s
there, a reminder that even when you think you know how things work, they can
surprise you. That’s what this detail is, and that’s what this story is.</p>

<p>May 4th was my birthday, which I learned a few years ago coincides with the

<p>New working title is: <strong>In the pale Darkness of Dawn</strong>. Casing tbc.</p>
<p>Due to conferencing and traveling and <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/857427137925529600">the effect that has on my
writing</a> as well as a very unfortunate (and frustrating) bout of
flu or cold or whatever in the last week of April, I didn’t get as much writing
done as I’d hoped.</p>
<p>I have about 6k of material written, but I do have a fairly large amount of
notes and a good outline for two of the four threads in the fic. So it’s not
too bad. And now that I’m nearing the final design of this fic (or have already
achieved it? it’s hard to tell), it should go much faster.</p>
<p>The <em>form</em> of the fic has also evolved from more traditional prose in long
sections and chapters, towards smaller single-scene sections ranging from 600
to 1500 words in length each, and then organised in semi-chronological order
and grouped in chapters. It’s a particular form, and it provides interesting
possibilities, like making it very easy to present the same scene from multiple
point of views, almost in a side-by-side manner. It’s also much closer to my
own ‘natural’ writing style.</p>
<h2 id="play-by-play"><a class="header" href="#play-by-play">Play By Play</a></h2>
<p>I went to <a href="http://playbyplay.co.nz/">Play By Play</a>! Both the festival (for two of the days) and the
conference. I <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23pbp17%40passcod">tweeted a bunch</a>. Honestly, I’m not a game developer. I
think it’s something I might want to do later on?</p>
<p>Mostly, I went because I wanted to do something different, it sounded like a
cool event, and I knew there would be some great talks at least. (There were!)</p>
<p>So soon after NZ.js(con), it might have been too much city and crowd at once,
though. I was mostly fine during the festival days, which I spent sometimes at
the expo space and a lot walking around Wellington (eating stuff and drinking
coffee and climbing up Mt Victoria like I try to do everytime I go to Welly),
but on the day of the con… I think I blanked out for most of the morning
shuffle, at least until talks started really going. And after the con, I was
definitely frazzled; I was so out of it and wanting <em>away</em> that I walked in
completely the wrong direction for a good kilometre before I realised!</p>
<p>So, I won’t be going down to cities and crowdy events for a little bit.</p>
<p>I did get a nice haircut out of it, though.</p>
<h2 id="cargo-watch"><a class="header" href="#cargo-watch">Cargo Watch</a></h2>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch/releases/tag/v5.0.0">released Cargo Watch v5.0.0</a>. It’s bittersweet because it’s kinda
giving up on the original project that made Notify a reality, but I eventually
realised that I really had no interest in implementing and maintaining the
intricacies of process groups and restarting servers on three different
platforms, and that Cargo Watch is a <em>cargo tool</em>.</p>
<p>So now we embed <a href="https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec">watchexec</a>, which does all the stuff I don’t want to do way
better than I would ever have done, and leaves me to crafting a cargo-focused

<p>A small single-purpose development tool for server reloading. Initially from a

for Linux/Mac/Unix. The name <a href="https://github.com/passcod/catflap">Catflap</a> is both because it’s a small door that
you install so that you don’t have to constantly open and close and open and

<p>I was initially skeptical of the benefits, but testing it convinced me!</p>

<h2 id="in-the-pale-darkness-of-dawn"><a class="header" href="#in-the-pale-darkness-of-dawn">In the pale darkness of dawn</a></h2>
<p>Did a slight rework of the story to have it stand as two distinct fics,
especially following my reading of <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio">Vanity Fair’s excellent Star Wars
cover</a>. The first story centers around the Resistance, and has quick
but persistent mentions of the Saka (my main OC) story, which features a lot of
great worldbuilding but which I’ll leave to the side for now. I don’t want to
overwhelm the first fic by looking like a completely different universe from
the get go, even though I tie it in pretty strongly to various canon plot
points (and it’s a really cool little world that I absolutely love writing).</p>
<p>The main fic starts around the same time the Aftermath novels do. It
invalidates a lot of what the latter Aftermath books plot out, especially on
the founding and role of the Resistance, but that’s an AU for you.</p>
<p>Finding and writing Leia’s voice and role is probably the hardest and I’m
pretty sure I haven’t quite gotten there. Fortunately I’ve deliberately put her
back, away from the main storylines, from the very start. But she’s still in a
lot of the in-universe plots, so she has to appear and she does affect
everything, so I can’t just ignore her.</p>
<p>Luke is much easier, probably because there’s a lot more freedom to write him
how I want him? There’s a lot less canon material around Luke, especially the
newer stuff, and what’s there is pretty straightforward. However, this fic
doesn’t feature Luke front and centre either, so it’s not too much of a worry
at this point.</p>
<p>As I commented to a colleague a few weeks back, I had to create a lot of OC
extras. There’s just not enough non-humans and not enough non-males in
Rebellion and Alliance High Command, and that really sucks. It’s not even
trying to maintain a balance or anything, it’s that when I think up a scene I
place beings in it that are kind of a blob of “I want that kinda thing”
feelings. Then I flesh them out, at least to give them a name and a description
if the writing needs it, and to figure out logistics like who moves where and
what they’re wearing and the movements they’re going to make with their arms or
other appendages, plus the facial expressions, even down to the verbs I can use
to punctuate their dialogue.</p>
<p>But I don’t like just pulling beings out of thin air, so I go look at the wiki
and the books I have and the canon ref sheets I made, and guess what, something
like 80% of the character pool is Human Male. Not only is that incredibly
boring, it clashes horribly with the scene I built up in my mind. Like, yeah,
there’ll be a few, but it’s not going to be 80%. It’s worse for the gender
distribution; some pools of characters have a 95% or higher male content, which
is plain ridiculous. So I create OC extras. I’m constantly running out of
names, it’s a real problem!</p>
<h2 id="a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#a-new-project">A new project</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been quietly designing, speccing out, and writing <a href="https://github.com/passcod/stalc">a stack calculator in
the spirit of <code>dc</code>, but more legible</a>. Instead of being character-based,
it’s whitespace-separated. It has first-class support for a variety of number
formats, dates, times and durations, booleans, strings, comments. It’s a simple
little language, too, so I’ll get to experiment with all that a language is.</p>
<p>Right now I’m writing the parser, and writing out the bullet-point spec I
started with into a more precise form. It’s not a toy, but it has no great
aspirations, either. It just wants to be a calculator.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-job"><a class="header" href="#a-new-job">A new job</a></h2>
<p>I’ve successfully applied and interviewed for and obtained a brand new job at
another local tech company. I’ve been at <a href="http://www.mckay.co.nz/">McKay</a> for over two and a half years,
and in that time it’s grown, shrinked, evolved, and denatured. I really liked
the people there, but I’ve grown cynical about the company itself, and that’s a
good sign as any that change is needed.</p>
<p>In three weeks I’ll start at <a href="http://uber.co.nz/">Uber</a>, no, not the taxi company. They’re a little
ISP serving Northland and Whangarei since 2008. It’s a completely new sector for
me, but I don’t know much more than that just yet. To be discovered!</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI">Neil Gaiman speaking to students</a> last week, and
it reminded me that I did have specific things I’ve wanted to do forever. Unlike
Gaiman, though, I’ve never noted them anywhere, so I’ll search my memories and
write them down here as I find them again:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to invent something.</li>
<li>I want to publish a scientific paper.</li>
<li>I want to forge a blade.</li>
<li>I want to travel to Antarctica.</li>
<li>I want to pilot a glider.</li>
<li>I want to learn a martial art.</li>
<li>I want to build a giant machine.</li>
<li>I want to live in a lighthouse for a bit.</li>
<li>I want to publish a novel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so they’re a bit more like dreams. Still, I think I could get to achieve
at least some of them in the next few decades!</p>
<h2 id="end-of-a-job"><a class="header" href="#end-of-a-job">End of a job</a></h2>
<p>This has been a very <em>very</em> busy month, and absolutely exhausting. Due to the
large amounts of operational knowledge I had accumulated without opportunity to
pass it on at my last job, as well as no less than <strong>three</strong> last minute
large-scale migrations that I needed to be part of to ensure a smooth move (I
hope!), I spent my last month at McKay flat out trying to document and finish
everything right up to my last day.</p>
<p>I was very happy to be done with it all!</p>
<h2 id="start-of-a-new-one"><a class="header" href="#start-of-a-new-one">Start of a new one</a></h2>
<p>I started at Uber (not the taxi company) last week. It’s going well! There’s a
lot — and I do mean a <em>lot</em> — of technical details which I’m going to have to
get my head around, including a whole bunch of protocols and acronyms I only
have a vague grasp on.</p>
<p>On a human level, there’s two things I’m really happy about with this new job,
although it <em>is</em> subject to confirmation as I work there longer.</p>
<p>Externally, it is astoundingly refreshing and comfortable to work with someone
who <em>knows their shit</em>, and makes similar jumps of thought when reasoning about
code and problems.</p>
<p>Internally, I am no longer stressed the fuck up and in <em>two days</em> that has
had noticeable effects on my tiredness and well-being, despite technically
working longer hours. Also, I now have a flexible hour-long lunch, and holy shit
is this nice. It took me a bit to break the habit to have a fast lunch, but now
I take the entire hour to walk to the Town Basin (a kilometre away), have lunch
there, watching the boats and <em>passants</em>, and walk back. Awesome.</p>
<p>On a project level, I can’t really say because I haven’t seen enough yet, but
what little I <em>have</em> leads me to believe that there is <em>so much fucking
potential</em> and that while there will be some tedium as we work with a massive
codebase with a decade of history in its commits, there’s many interesting
things to be done.</p>
<p>From the outset, I expect to stay at Uber for one or two years, and I very much
expect to leave the system in a better place. I’m excited about this!</p>
<h2 id="much-writing"><a class="header" href="#much-writing">Much writing</a></h2>
<p>I’m nearly finished with the full first draft of the first story in the “In The
Darkness of Dawn” universe Star Wars fanfic. This one is also canon-compliant,
ignoring some small references to future dawnverse stories, and stands fairly
well alone even if you’ve only seen the films.</p>
<p>Once done, I’ll do one or two editing passes myself, before either publishing
outright or finding some advance/beta readers for more feedback.</p>
<p>As of yet, there is no title. The working title is <strong>Naema</strong>, from the second
main character and OC, but that might change before publication.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="august-2017"><a class="header" href="#august-2017">August 2017</a></h1>
<h2 id="me-and-the-dark-always"><a class="header" href="#me-and-the-dark-always">Me and the dark always</a></h2>
<p>I drafted a game called <strong>Me and the dark always</strong> that tries to go against the
general practice / consequence of current designs that the “looking” action in
games is free. It ended up being a slice-of-life game concept which deals with
tiredness through a few aspects.</p>
<p>I’ve got most of the mechanics drawn up, some basic art sketches, the story
elements for a limited demo, and some vision down. I have a rough idea of the
high-level implementation. I’m aiming to continue developing the idea <em>on paper</em>
until Yule, then trying for a first playable in early 2018.</p>
<h2 id="naema"><a class="header" href="#naema">Naema</a></h2>
<p>In early July, I got inspiration for writing some of the chapters that were
missing from the first draft. In mid-July I rewrote the entire outline and
added a lot more details, revealing that for consistency and pacing I had at
least a bunch more chapters of material to write, and a bunch more things
to add in existing chapters.</p>
<p>I continued adding to and revising the outline throughout the month and even
amended it today, and this week, and last week. It’s a much more <em>living</em>
document, now.</p>
<p>In early August, the outline and its detailed timeline let me catch a profound
anachronicity in a reference to future characters I had thought so clever to
include but had actually messed up by <em>fifteen years</em>, so it’s definitely
helping!</p>
<p>Before, I estimated this work to go for about 20-25k words. It looks like it’s
going more for the 50k mark. But it’s a much better work than I ever imagined,
so that’s ok.</p>
<p>Writing pace has picked up, and my goal (which I think is generous) is to start
publishing in December at the latest. I’ll probably spend NaNoWriMo doing final
revisions and polish, if that’s the case. If I finish earlier, who knows?</p>
<p>I published the prologue (and first bit of Naema I’d written) <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11542755">on AO3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="job"><a class="header" href="#job">Job</a></h2>
<p>New job is going good. Got my first “boring” project this week, a refactor with
little in the way of exciting parts. It’s a bit tedious, but it’s also nice and

place. Not a dull day passes, with these two!</p>

<p>I published another snippet, but this time not from Naema. I feel like posting
more of these, but for now that’s all I have that’s not full of “TK” editing
annotations and placeholders, and that’s standalone enough that it actually
makes sense without too much context.</p>
<p><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/11809908">In that bright land from which I come</a>.</p>
<p>Writing Naema is going well, despite work being more tiring than I’d thought
this past two weeks, which has slowed down writing a bit. Nonetheless, I stick
for now by my estimate of being done by Yule.</p>
<h2 id="cogitare-1"><a class="header" href="#cogitare-1">Cogitare</a></h2>
<p>After unsuccessfully trying, for two weeks, to create a backend for Cogitare
first in Node.js, and then in Rust, I turned to PHP and pumped out a working
read-only backend with all the bells and whistles in four hours, with the rest
of the features to be finished today.</p>
<p>I’ve also rebranded all components of Cogitare to have consistent naming: they
are now all named after the nominative gerund of a Latin verb that could be a
metaphor for what it is they do. (Nominative gerund = “Verbing” used as a noun.)</p>
<p>Doing so, I’ve noticed that the entire thing comes together as using each of my
four main languages, that I know in reasonable depth and use often.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cogitare: thinking.</strong> The ensemble (and the website, by association). <em>Node</em></li>
<li><strong>Legare: reading.</strong> Parsing and normalising services. <em>Rust</em></li>
<li><strong>Dicere: telling.</strong> API and backend. <em>PHP</em></li>
<li><strong>Rogare: asking.</strong> IRC bot. <em>Ruby</em></li>

<h2 id="meta"><a class="header" href="#meta">Meta</a></h2>
<p>Someone asked how I edit those updates. Here’s how:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dqHeo63.png" alt="A list of commits that have gone into this update so far" /></p>
<p>I have two scripts that I use extensively:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.bin/monthly</code> opens the current monthly update, creating it if needed</li>
<li><code>.bin/fanficline</code> takes any fanfic URL, fetches and parses metadata, and
outputs a line of markdown formatted according to my conventions. It’s used
with vim’s <code>r!</code> command, which inserts the output of a command in the buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each fanfic entry is written and committed (using the initials of the fic)
shortly (often <em>immediately</em>) after I read it.</p>
<p>For everything else, I write up what I’ve done in the month as I think of
including it, per section. Everything is pushed to the blog posts’ repo as I
write, which updates the live blog instance.</p>
<p>Blograph supports future-dated posts, so provided I know the URL of a post, I
can see how it renders before it actually gets published. Publication is a
passive process: when the time rolls over, new requests to the blog’s front
page, tags, feeds, previous and parent posts, etc get the “new” link. There’s no
manual intervention at all.</p>
<p>I generally schedule a tweet with the update’s link and a few words about its
contents at 1pm NZ time on the day it publishes, and use that morning to check
over the post, its render, and links, to make sure it’s fine. Sometimes I miss a
few things, which I fix and push out very soon after publication.</p>
<p>I find that this mode of updating not only makes sure I write things as they are
fresh in mind, but also makes sure that I write <em>continuously</em> throughout each
month, instead of only doing a burst of writing up an update at the end of a
month. It also makes the commitment much easier to bear, given I only ever have
to write in tiny blobs of relevant-now content, and not write an entire
multi-thousand-word update in one go.</p>
<p>While some updates have been lighter in content than others, I haven’t missed
any. I’ve spent the year so far writing more each month than I did in the
entirety of 2016, and that feels absolutely awesome.</p>
<h2 id="donations"><a class="header" href="#donations">Donations</a></h2>
<p>I started my round of selecting organisations and making donations for this

ceiling, and it turned out to be a great success at little effort! If you switch
this blog to Night mode by clicking the tiny button in the bottom left corner,
you’ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>That was done by finding a high-res picture of the night sky, then modifying
curves to eliminate all the variation in black and dark blues, and converting
all black in alpha. Then some touch up work was done to eliminate as much as
possible blue and red halos around some galaxies that were visible on a white
background. Finally, I used GIMP’s seamless tiling algorithm tool to generate
the tile and layered it using CSS.</p>

<p>After doing some quick calculations, I found out that if I write about three
thousand more words in this blog before the end of the year, I’ll have written
more in this blog this year than <em>all prior years combined</em>! Now that’s a pretty
fun goal.</p>
<p>I achieved this handily when I did experiments around transcripts later on.</p>
<h3 id="naema-1"><a class="header" href="#naema-1">Naema</a></h3>
<p>Writing has been slower than usual, which is perhaps pushing back the end date.</p>
<p>I have been having difficulties reconciling Leia’s character with how I portray
her in the one interaction that’s really important in this fic, my plans for the
story warring with who she is verily. I think I’ve got it now, but Leia is
definitely the hardest character I’ve had to write about.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing and thinking a lot more about Thabeskan culture and history,
as that is an important part of the interactions between my two protagonists.
That may have caused a slight change of structure and that in turn may push back
completion, but oh well. So long as it improves the story…</p>

stalwart of these past years at this house, and it brought us a vast and diverse
set of films even when we couldn’t afford downloading or streaming movies in the
early times when the internet was capped and even slower than it is now. We’ll
miss it, even though we weren’t watching as many DVDs recently, having
diversified the sources of films we were getting. However, Fatso was the only
way to get non-mainstream or foreign films, especially French (with original
soundtrack) as well as many niche films from Latin America and the Middle East.
Those are lost to us for now, unless and until we find another way. So thank you
Fatso! We loved you.</p>

<p>After a couple Spotify Discovers that didn’t really turn up anything I liked, I
decided to start my annual “pick a playlist from all the stuff I listened to
this year” early. That involves listening to all 500 songs I saved throughout
the previous 10 months carefully enough to decide whether they make the cut or
nah (which took two weeks), and then going through the resulting set to carve a
<em>theme</em> that makes the mess a whole and remove the extra. I’m still going
through that part.</p>
<p>This year it’s looking like a mix and weave around tunes of the fabulous <a href="https://www.norahjones.com/">Norah
Jones</a>, beautiful contemporary instrumental pieces by swedish composers <a href="https://www.augustwl.com/">August
Wilhelmsson</a> and <a href="https://cargocollective.com/martingauffin">Martin Gauffin</a>, <a href="https://lorde.co.nz/">Lorde</a>’s latest, and the enchanting and
engaged vocals of <a href="http://viennateng.com/">Vienna Tang</a>. It’ll probably reach slightly less than 200
tracks. As usual, I pick a name that is both a celestial reference and has
subtle personal significance. This year it’s <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5dIozbsC5eloBkX2OaPHoj">Atarau</a></strong>.</p>

ever, more than a hundred prompts and writing seeds are filed into Dicere ready
for consumption through website and <code>!prompt</code>.</p>
<p>And at the end of november I’ll pack it back up, not completely hidden away, but

<h2 id="writing-2"><a class="header" href="#writing-2">Writing</a></h2>
<p>I published <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12722796">Chosen Names</a>, a Star
Wars crackfic about ridiculous amounts of titles, as inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/NaNoWordSprints/status/930310576214913024">a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote 30k words for my NaNoWriMo, all on the Star Wars fanfic that I’ve been
calling Naema or Dawnverse or “In the Pale Darkness of Dawn”. For a nano thing,
it failed to reach 50k. But for a story thing, I fleshed out a lot more of the
immediate background of the characters, and solidified many ideas I’ve had
recently.</p>
<p>The story is now written as several volumes instead of one plus some side
stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story starts with Jeira, last Keeper of History of her family line,
thus holder of one of the Keys to the Thabeskan archives, and wife to Beca, an
offworlder who studied to be a historian in the Archiva Republica. When the
Empire arrives, the family is forced into survival as their jobs become illegal,
and they become part of a network of resistance spanning the planet and
beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We then look to Patra, current Clan Head of the Fardi, looking both to
maintain the Clan’s standing and responsibility in Thabeska, and to change its
mission from profit in smuggling back to being the protectors of the small
world, and regain a more active hand into its politics and direction. When the
Empire interrupts those plans by replacing the officials of one of the most
remote Republic worlds with its own, the Clan starts a dangerous double game
of staying in the good graces of the Imperial Major ‘in charge’, and keeping
the population as safe as they can while also planning for their independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Patra Fardi’s youngest niece, Hedala, is Force-sensitive although she doesn’t
know it. What she knows is she has keen instincts and she’s always better off,
in small ways and in large, when she follows them, even when they’re very odd.
Jeira’s and Beca’s daughter Naema was left alone when her parents suddenly
disappeared one night. She’s had to survive on her own, and she’s focused all
her efforts on escaping Thabeska. One day, she finds an opportunity and steals
away on a Fardi shuttle. When they land in Rinn, Hedala stays behind, citing
feeling off — which the crew assumes is land-sickness: not uncommon in
first-time travelers after a long passage. Naema proceeds to steals the
shuttle, unknowingly kidnapping the important child! From adversity grows a
reluctant partnership (and perhaps more!) as they try to find their way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty fun to write, and I do plan on publishing it at some point. However,
I’d like to have an entire work finished before I do that. I know better than to
commit myself to deadlines I know I’ll blow, but I expect to have at least the
stories of Jeira and Patra out there before mid-2018.</p>

<p>I decided to put the Dawnverse on hold for now. I’ve got several stories I want
to tell within it, but I pretty much burned myself off it. I’ll return to it at
some point. One thing is particular is that it feels a lot more original than
fanfic at this point, and I want to explore that. But not now.</p>
<p>I started <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13125189">a Time Loop Star Wars fic around the New Jedi Order massacre</a>.
It’s simple and requires a lot less thought and I’m writing it as it comes with
somewhat fuzzy plans for storylines, and it’s a lot of fun (as well as being a
lot of drama).</p>
<p>Depending on how long it runs, it might become my “medium-sized creative
project” for the year. The year is long still, though.</p>

<h2 id="constellationd"><a class="header" href="#constellationd">Constellationd</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been writing a prototype/MVP for a server agent that uses an on-demand
cluster-wide consensus algorithm rather than a Raft-like always-on consensus of
only a few master nodes plus a bunch of clients.</p>
<p>I have set myself fairly strict resource limits so that it can be set up easily
from one to many hundred machines, and use the least amount of memory it
comfortably can so it can be deployed to 512MB VMs (or even those tiny 256MB ARM
servers that some hosts in Europe offer) without eating half the machine’s RAM.</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to monitor and manage any number of machines, or even to
use it locally for development, testing, or tooling purposes.</p>
<p>Beyond the software itself, the project is a way to get a lot more comfortable
with Tokio.rs as well as learn more about networking, distributed setups, and
protocol design + parsing.</p>
<p>The repo is here: https://github.com/passcod/constellationd</p>

<h2 id="april-fools"><a class="header" href="#april-fools">April Fools</a></h2>
<p>This year I did something of my own.</p>
<p>In early March, at work, while pairing, we typo’d PHP’s <code>??</code> Null Coalesce
operator into <code>???</code>. That was pretty hilarious. We couldn’t stop ourselves from
imagining what such a symbol could mean.</p>
<p>One idea stuck, as being both on point, completely overpowered, and yet utterly
practical. As April was coming up, I floated a ridiculous idea: what if we
proposed it for real?</p>
<p>Ultimately, work keeps us busy, so we don’t really have time to spend on
frivolous bullshit like that. Instead, I quietly worked at it in spare hours.</p>
<p>As part of my initial research, I found that PHP has a fairly well-delimited
process for proposing changes, and it all starts with a posting on the mailing
list to gauge interest. I couldn’t do that! It wouldn’t be an April Fools if I
had to disclose it prior to April. Also, I didn’t think it would be nice to
annoy the PHP developers with this. People on Twitter (or Slack, or wherever you
came from) at least are <em>already</em> wasting their time.</p>
<p>So I skipped that step, and wrote up a PHP RFC as seriously as I could. I
included motivations, discussions of why existing features weren’t enough, use
cases, examples, sample code, comparisons to other languages.</p>
<p>I even checked out PHP’s source and coded up a very nasty hack of an
implementation of the feature. And I added tests.</p>
<p>This was meant to be a complete joke, something that could not exist in a
thousand years, and yet I fell into my own trap. As I wrote it, as I described
it, as I defended it, I came to appreciate just how useful the feature might be.</p>
<p>I still don’t think it will ever get accepted, and certainly not with its <code>???</code>
syntax. Even if I see many places I could use it, it’s still very outlandish.</p>
<p>But for you, dear reader, if you haven’t come here from the proposal itself, I
leave you with a proposal that captured my attention for the best part of a
month. Here is <a href="https://github.com/passcod/rfc-exception-coalesce-operator"><code>???</code>: The Exception Coalesce Operator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-practice"><a class="header" href="#keyboard-practice">Keyboard practice</a></h2>
<p>Practicing every 2-3 days (sometimes every day) for 20 minutes on Keybr, I
clocked up 5 hours of practice which got me at acceptable speed over half the
keyboard (lowercase letters only at this stage).</p>
<p>So guesstimating, that should mean that in another 5 hours or so I’ll have the
entire alphabet down, and I’ll be able to switch uppercase on, then symbols.
After that, I’ll start using the keyboard for minor works. With a bit of
perseverance I hope to always use my Keyboard.io at work in July/August.</p>

<h2 id="birthday-1"><a class="header" href="#birthday-1">Birthday</a></h2>
<p>I turned a quarter century, which… actually it sounded pretty cool in my head
and even aloud but now it just sounds <strong>o l d</strong>. I’m still the youngest at work,
somehow. Even counting the “intern”. I can only assume that won’t last.</p>
<p>I got myself a <a href="https://remarkable.com">reMarkable</a>, of which I had high expectations, and it performs
even better than I thought. I’ve been wanting a tool like this basically since
forever, and I think it will fill a gap in my tooling that nothing I’d ever
tried really came close to.</p>
<p>From others, I got chocolate and alcohol and live Jazz, which was pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-learning"><a class="header" href="#keyboard-learning">Keyboard learning</a></h2>
<p>I’m not practicing with a very high regularity, but I’m managing a few sessions
a week, which is progressing me at an okay pace. So far I’ve totalled about 8
hours of cumulative practice, which brought me to about two thirds of the
lowercase keyboard at good accuracy and speed.</p>
<p>My test with keyboards and layout variants is whether I can confidently enter my
passphrases into terminal prompts (which offer absolutely zero input feedback).
Once I can achieve that, generally, I can use the keyboard for everyday tasks
and will get better much faster thus. I’m obviously not there yet.</p>

<p>I got some dental surgery done at long last early this month, and the recovery
was somewhat longer than I’d thought, which didn’t help with projects. I’m all
good now, though! (And two teeth lighter.)</p>
<h2 id="watchexec"><a class="header" href="#watchexec">Watchexec</a></h2>
<p>This month I volunteered to take on the <a href="https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec">Watchexec</a> project, to ensure that pull
requests and issues and new features would be finally tackled. Matt Green, the
project’s originator and principal author up til now, has recently gotten more
busy at work and most importantly, become a first-time parent. Congratulations
to him! That did mean that there was no more time for the project.</p>
<p>I spent a few evenings reviewing the entire source and looking through all
issues and pull requests, then made my first release on Sunday 19th, and another
one on Sunday 9th after a little more coding to smooth over old PRs. I hope to
work through more of the issues as we go through, but I am very aware that this
is yet another project on top of my stack of already pending stuff, so I’m
pacing myself with a lot of care.</p>
<h2 id="notify-2"><a class="header" href="#notify-2">Notify</a></h2>
<p>Notify advances slowly. This is mostly a matter of time, now: most of the
framework is ready and awaits only filling up the gaps.</p>
<p>I am getting very interesting snapshots of futures 0.3 and the async/await
support in Rust itself, which could mean improved ergonomics and better
development. In the meantime, though, I’m keeping with what I have.</p>
<p>The Rust inotify wrapper has recently <a href="https://github.com/inotify-rs/inotify/pull/105">gained a feature</a> to use futures and Tokio
Reform, which might make it a lot easier to integrate, although it may be that
the access I require for the Backend is too advanced for the nicely-wrapped
version. To be seen.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/passcod/notify/pull/162">wonderful contributor</a> has spent some time upgrading all of the libraries in
the <strong>v4 branch</strong>. This will likely be the last release with the old code!</p>
<h2 id="splash-1"><a class="header" href="#splash-1">Splash</a></h2>
<p>My mysteriously-named project is a foray into some really old code, and a
documentation effort more than a coding effort. It’s a nice change of pace, even
though it can be really intense… I like it for the different <em>kind</em> of work.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will see a release this summer, but with everything else piled on,
I’m making myself no promises.</p>
<h2 id="certainly-1"><a class="header" href="#certainly-1"><a href="https://github.com/passcod/certainly">Certainly</a></a></h2>
<p>Frustrated by the awful state of certificate tooling, especially for such common
things as generating self-signed certificates, I made <a href="https://github.com/passcod/certainly">a small tool</a>
that makes the whole thing as easy and simple as possible! It especially excels
at multidomain certificates, and has an extra feature to be able to create a
local CA and sign certificates that way. All in minimal fuss and no ambiguity:</p>

pushed away to the next opportunity.</p>

<p>This year it got some sweet upgrades, including a new database backend (to store
richer information and perform more powerful queries), a bunch more sources for
its <code>!name</code> command, and an adaptation to Discord because the channel moved.</p>
<h2 id="art"><a class="header" href="#art">Art</a></h2>
<p>I’ve started on a cool art project mapping all earthquakes around New Zealand
from 1900 til now (early data is a bit imprecise, but it works out) using some
interesting techniques for the rendering. I hope to be done during the month.</p>
<p>Specifically, after doing the data crunching, I transposed the key positions
onto an A2 piece of white solid cardboard / foamboardish material. Then I
painted each dot (hundreds of dots so far, at about ⅓ done) to approximate size
in clear nail polish resin. The idea is then to splash ink onto the sheet, and
the ink should slide off the resin while adhering to the cardboard.</p>
<p>In the end, I hope to have an earthquake map in a form reminiscent to a night
sky star map, with some interesting random flow effects from the ink, and a
tactile/glossy feel to its surface.</p>
<p>We’ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>I ended up writing 400 words of fic and working nigh-on continuously on the
bot, adding myriad improvements and setting things up for the future.</p>
<p>The first big thing was that the community moved from IRC to Discord, so I had
to get the bot ported over asap! That took me two nights, with the most
essential functionality available that first night. Initially the move seemed
uncertain, such that there may have been a split or dual-usage, but as Discord
got more familiar it emerged as the clear favourite. Following that, the bot was
initially ported to be available on both media at once, but IRC support was
dropped fairly quickly, lifting a huge burden off development and testing time.</p>
<p>During the month an incident happened that put us in contact with the Australian
community, especially its resident bot and developer, Winnie and Dawnbug. That
may spark off interesting collaborative arrangements.</p>
<p>Its todo list and scope has grown, and there is more to come!</p>
<h2 id="laser-1"><a class="header" href="#laser-1">Laser</a></h2>

<p>Purplecon was highly informative and very well put together. Unsure if it will
continue, but I would definitely go back, as the more… sensible… part of
the week.</p>
<p>Kiwicon was <em>an experience</em>. It’s definitely the <em>fun</em> conference. I had lots to
bring back to everyone, including new Te Reo words for papa, insight in the
security aspects of tech we’d been looking at for work, some swag for
colleagues, and the knowledge I do okay in big conferencing crowds for myself.</p>
<p>That last one will come in handy for next year’s Worldcon!</p>

<p>The 10th-day thing got old. It was an artifact of when I actually started this
monthly thing, but the confusion of writing about half of the past month and
half of the current was really odd.</p>

<p>Two years ago when I did those every month, I did make an effort to get
something done every month. Last year it was a bit lackluster. This year, I’m
basically throwing in the towel. Updates will happen, but they might not happen
every month. Or maybe they will. Habits are hard to break, and I’m not trying to
break this one, so we’ll see how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="armstrong-1"><a class="header" href="#armstrong-1">Armstrong</a></h2>
<p>I think I’m ready to start talking about this.</p>
<p>Armstrong is a project that has been brewing for the past year or so.</p>
<p>The concept comes, as often with new projects, out of frustration and want.
Armstrong is a job system. Or a job framework. Maybe a job queue. Task queue.
Orchestrator. Scheduler. It is an evolution of <a href="http://gearman.org/">Gearman</a>, adding features rather
than removing them (there are many extra-minimal job queues out there), and
keeping to the patterns that make Gearman strong in my opinion.</p>
<p>There is a laundry list of features, but one I want to describe here is the
priority system.</p>
<p>Priorities in Gearman work on the basis of three FIFO queues per worker, where
“worker” means a particular type of task that’s handled by a pool of worker
clients. Those three queues are <em>high</em>, <em>normal</em>, <em>low</em>. Jobs, by default, go
into the <em>normal</em> queue, but you can decide which queue they go to explicitly.
The <em>normal</em> queue is only processed when there are no <em>high</em> jobs, and so on.
Within a queue, jobs are processed in order.</p>
<p>This leads to patterns and rules being established in userspace to ensure good
system behaviour. For example, pushing to the <em>high</em> queue is strictly
controlled, so that it remains empty most of the time, except for when something
urgent comes through. Otherwise it’s all too easy to need an urgent compute and
having its jobs just queue up politely <em>riiiight</em> at the back.</p>
<p>Armstrong’s priorities work on the basis of a single giant dynamic queue, not
only for each worker, but for all workers all at once. Priority, at the
interface, is expressed in <strong>time expectation</strong>.</p>
<p>One can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t care when this job runs, I just want it done sometime.</li>
<li>I need this job to run within the hour.</li>
<li>These tasks all need to finish within 500 milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Armstrong then figures out how to achieve that.</p>
<p>The most obvious option is to re-order the queue based on this timing metric,
but that’s not all it can do.</p>
<p>Firstly, as a bit of background, Armstrong keeps records of what jobs ran when,
where, for how long, etc. This is for audit, debugging, monitoring. It’s also
for making priority and scheduling decisions.</p>
<p>Given a job description, the system can query this record and derive the
expected duration of the job, for example by averaging the last few runs.
Without you having to say so, it knows how long jobs take, and can re-order the
queue based on that. Even better, it knows how long jobs take on different
hosts, so it can schedule more efficiently, again without prompting.</p>
<p>Secondly, on an opt-in basis, Armstrong workers may be interruptible. This may
be achieved through custom logic, or it can be achieved using kernel interfaces,
like <code>SIGSTOP</code>, <code>SIGCONT</code>, or <code>SuspendProcess()</code>.</p>
<p>If an urgent job comes through and whatever is currently running will not finish
in time, Armstrong interrupts the jobs, schedules and runs the urgent jobs, then
un-pauses the jobs.</p>
<p>This combination of granular priority, record querying, and control superpowers
makes efficient compute use easy and eliminates hours of setup and discussions.</p>
<p>And through this one feature, you can already see other aspects of the system.
More later!</p>
<p>Armstrong is still in development, and no parts of it are yet available.</p>

<h2 id="notify-3"><a class="header" href="#notify-3">Notify</a></h2>
<p>There’s a bunch of work happening on Notify at the moment. I’ve basically taken
it out of being “frozen” and back into maintainership. I do <em>not</em> want to spend
any significant amount of time on it, but I welcome anyone else to develop
features, fixes, improvements, etc, and I’m doing the actual maintainer thing of
review, advice, guidance, merging things, running rustfmt, keeping CI going, and
generally being an active project once again.</p>
<p>A lot of Big Names use Notify now, and it’s honestly cool. It was mostly
background radiation for a long time, like people used it and some people
contributed features, but it was very quiet, very passive consumership. Now
there’s a lot of good energy and good people doing great work on it, and I’m in
a much better place psychologically, so I think it will regain some shine!</p>
<p>As part of this sorta soft reboot, I went through the entire commit log and
backfilled <a href="https://github.com/passcod/notify/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">the entire changelog</a>
down to the very first release, which was fun (if a bit menially tedious).
Notify started pre-Rust-1.0, and that must seem like quite a strange period for
people who haven’t lived it, or even for <em>me</em>, now. The past is weird!</p>
<h2 id="kai"><a class="header" href="#kai">Kai</a></h2>
<p>A project I’ve been wanting to do for ages, but it’s also deceptively big and
really I just put down very minimal bones and some notes and not much else.</p>
<p>The idea started as a “flexible curry recipe generator.” Basically input what
ingredients you have, and it walks you through it. But then I started wanting to
integrate a lot of other things, most importantly something radical: a slider of
“how much time do you want to spend here.”</p>
<p>So the recipe would have all those parts that are timed and possibly ranged as
well, and would cut down the recipe steps and time based on what kind of
timeframe you’re looking at. Sure, caramelising onions makes for deliciousness,
but you <em>can</em> skip it, and in fact you can skip the onions entirely if pressed
for time or if you don’t <em>have</em> onions right this moment. And cutting onions as
fine as possible is an excellent way to caramelise them to perfection, but it
also takes ages, even more without practice, so just a rough chop will do nicely
if you just have to get to it. And that’s just onions! There’s so much more.</p>
<p>The slider would be at the very top, and it would grey out meat/veggie choices
that you just <em>can’t do</em> with that kind of time. Carrots. Potatoes. Some meats.
Etc etc etc.</p>
<p>You should still have a fair amount of choice and diversity at the extreme-low
of the scale. There are some really quick ways to cook a spicy meal that looks
like a curry. But I didn’t want to limit myself to just that, so I called it
‘Kai.’</p>
<h2 id="purple-sky"><a class="header" href="#purple-sky">Purple Sky</a></h2>
<p>Yay another project!</p>
<p>Actually this one is fairly older, and I’ve been slowly working at it. I’m
ramping up research and prototyping, and some people know what this is, but I’m
also keeping it way under wraps for now. This is something that might actually
turn into something profitable! So that’s exciting.</p>

<p>I have been spending most of the month <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1106093907174027265">trying</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1107512847821492225">cast a key</a> in epoxy. It’s
an interesting project to be sure, even if I’m doubtful as to its actual
success. Learning lots, making mistakes, making discoveries.</p>
<h2 id="housing"><a class="header" href="#housing">Housing</a></h2>
<p>I also moved on the first of the month. I now live in a much larger place than
before, although still by my lonesome! (I’m not complaining, I like it, it’s why
I chose it.) It’s got no carpet anywhere, fake-wood laminate plank and dark tile
floors, two storeys, ample parking space, in the middle of town but also in the
middle of greenery (although none I have to tend to), and honestly I like it a
lot. The rent is a bit high, but it’s not outrageous, either.</p>
<p>Consequently I’ve spent a while finding furniture and making things work. Stuff
is expensive! Sheesh. I did get some good deals, and with a bit of DIY and
low-key restoration I think I’ll get a nice setup out of it all. And it keeps my
hands busy!</p>
<h2 id="work"><a class="header" href="#work">Work</a></h2>
<p>After 10 months of work we’ve finally released a new customer website. Won’t
really say much about it here, but it’s good to be done, even if we’ll keep on
working on features. Relief and accomplishment.</p>
<p>We worked pretty hard to get it ready and launched before April, as no-one wants
to seriously release a new product around April Fools! Google can do its thing,
we’ll keep to not trying to surprise and upset our customers (yes I’m still
bitter about the Inbox thing).</p>
<h2 id="notify-4"><a class="header" href="#notify-4">Notify</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been preparing for a breaking release of the main branch. In the last few
days I’ve finalised the feature list of what I want in there; I’m taking the
opportunity to bundle a bunch of changes into it. I’m aiming for a mid-April
release, but plans do go awry around this project, so who knows.</p>
<p>This will be a good way to test how fast the adoption is. I’m expecting a few
months of earnest transition, followed by a long tail… maybe by the end of the
year it will be over, but I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>A new little project on the same proto-framework as I made for Armstrong. I want
to use a few features of Btrfs around volumes to make a lightweight deployment &amp;
artifact system. Aimed at small deployments of a few machines or projects, for
small teams or individuals. A lot of stuff in the space is made for super large
scale, and doesn’t make sense — despite hype — otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="what-1"><a class="header" href="#what-1">What</a></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://what.passcod.name">What</a></strong> is a new little tool I made this month, that tracks what I’m working
on at the moment. These monthly updates often have summaries of things I’ve
started or finished or want to talk about, but they don’t have everything and
they don’t really do any good job at showing continuity or breaks or anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://what.passcod.name">What</a> is not limited to fiction or software work, and has a space within each
entry for “media” links, i.e. Twitter threads about the activity. That also acts
as a kind of archive and historical reference.</p>
<p>So here you go! Watch me work away: <a href="https://what.passcod.name">what.passcod.name</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pinn-1"><a class="header" href="#pinn-1">Pinn</a></h2>
<p>I’ve started work on a browser extension to make reading, stats-ing, and
managing fanfics easier! I hope to be done sometime next month, and am working
on it in between working on…</p>
<h2 id="notify-50"><a class="header" href="#notify-50">Notify 5.0</a></h2>
<p>Not <strong>the</strong> Notify 5.0 vaporware release I’ve been talking for the past two
years, but an actual, made of real code, Notify release! It’s a big refactoring
that will fix a bunch of issues and open some cool possibilities…</p>
<p>but honestly? At the core it’s not even about that. This work and this release
is about me getting re-acquainted with the codebase as it stands today, and
bringing it forward to the standard I want it to be at now. I <em>didn’t know how
most of the library worked</em> until a few weeks ago. Obviously that made
supporting and maintaining it hard. So now I’ve got a much more solid knowledge
and I’m improving that every day.</p>
<p>This is both hard to admit, to myself too, and it’s not something I feel
comfortable sharing on or near the project itself (not very inspiring!), but I
feel okay sharing it here, and maybe I’ll work up to putting it out to a wider
audience over time, too.</p>

<h2 id="abandoning-notify"><a class="header" href="#abandoning-notify">Abandoning Notify</a></h2>
<p>I made the decision to abandon Notify. I wrote lots about it, both <a href="https://github.com/passcod/notify/issues/209">on Github</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1170626632089866240">on Twitter</a>, but the shortest justification is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Notify] sparks <em>negative joy</em>, so I’m Marie-Kondo-ing it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out however that abandoning such a large piece of software and my life
isn’t simple. I’m not taking it back, ever at all if I can manage it, but
getting to the point of it being off my hands completely is not all
straightforward. I do hope it gets there soonish, though, because otherwise
quite a few crates and part of the ecosystem will start not working anymore.</p>
<p>I also hope I’m making this transition less painful than other abandonments I’ve
seen in the OSS space before, though. My goal is to reclaim my own time and joy,
not to say fuck you to any part of Rust or cause misery to anyone.</p>
<h2 id="storq-1"><a class="header" href="#storq-1">Storq</a></h2>
<p>Hot on the heels of getting way more time, I got some motivation back! Who knew.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started working on Storq again. This is a rename of a project
initially called Q, which spawned from a project called Gearbox, which spawned
from another project also called Gearbox but not written in Rust. This all
started from a musing on making Gearman better, and so Storq is… not that.</p>
<p>Or at least, not recognisably that.</p>
<p>Storq is a construction on top of the Sled embedded advanced key-value store,
for the purpose of dynamic work queues with arbitrary ordering controlled by
application-provided functions.</p>
<p>At some point after many design drafts and documents I figured that the Gearman
queue model was a good idea, but not robust or versatile enough; Storq is the
attempt to create a new bedrock for a work processor system inspired by Gearman.</p>
<h2 id="splash-2"><a class="header" href="#splash-2">Splash</a></h2>
<p>I’ve also picked back up Splash, my ongoing HF radio propagation tooling
endeavour starting with a thoroughly-documented implementation of the ITM.</p>
<h2 id="holiday"><a class="header" href="#holiday">Holiday</a></h2>
<p>I went on vacation for four weeks to Europe and came back home early this month.
It was pretty great!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="december-2019"><a class="header" href="#december-2019">December 2019</a></h1>
<h2 id="donations-1"><a class="header" href="#donations-1">Donations</a></h2>
<p>This year I decided to forgo donating to organisations. This had many reasons,
most of which boiled down to most organisations sending me about a ream of paper
each in “pwease donate” advertising throughout this year, which I gather doesn’t
come cheap, so at my support level I estimate they spent at least half of my
dollars on asking me more dollars, which is ridiculous. I’m sure they also do
good work, I’m not sure they particularly need <em>my</em> cash to do that.</p>
<p>One organisation that is the exception, and the sole organisation in my donation
list this year is <a href="https://papa.org.nz">PAPA</a>, and I gave them $300 sometime back in May.</p>
<p>So here I was wondering what I should do. One thing I’ve always wanted to do
since I started doing this regularly but was never really sure how to is direct
donation, i.e. “just giving people money.” So this year, starting in November, I
went and actually tried that. I figured out the parameters and made <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1198020442444795904">a tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends, it’s donation season, point me to (New Zealand) queer and non-binary
people in need of help. I’ll fund (at my discretion, t&amp;c apply, standard
disclaimer, etc etc) until I reach this year’s donation budget.</p>
<p>(Budget not specified because not completely nailed down, but is somewhere
around $1500.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t really get many returns but then I trawled givealittle for matching
people and donated there too. By December 3rd I had spent about ⅔ the budget and
exhausted my search to this point, so I resolved to take two weeks before trying
again.</p>
<p>On December 20th, JK Rowling made an extremely TERFy tweet and I was kinda mad.
I was seeing a lot of condemnation from allies but not a lot of action. It’s
kinda hard to do anything to Rowling, though. Instead, I had <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1207897429447565315">this idea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In honour of JK Rowling… /s</p>
<p>I’m opening <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1198020442444795904">this</a> up to non-NZ, trans people in priority. I have
about $500 left in budget. Anything left at the end of the year will go to
<a href="https://www.ry.org.nz">RY</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in need, raise your hand (DM me your paypal or something); if you
know someone in need, point me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were a lot more people answering, and I was able to help all of them. So
that was a huge success. In total, I distributed more than $1500 to more than
twenty people, many of them trans, many of them in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an economic, macro-level kinda thing, donating all $1500 to <a href="https://www.ry.org.nz">RY</a>
would have helped more people, but it’s harder to see. And of course, none of
the people I gave money to are registered charities, so I won’t get any tax
rebate for the 2019 tax year. That’s alright. I mostly want to help people, and
this year I did that by distributing what is to me a little bit of cash to
people for whom it is a lot.</p>
<p>We’ll see what next year brings.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reading-archive"><a class="header" href="#reading-archive">Reading archive</a></h1>
<p>Starting from 2016 I kept track of the large amounts of fanfiction I read, and
occasionnally original fiction, non-fiction, comics, BD, etc.</p>
<p>For fanfiction, I also kept track of the words (for ongoing works, “at time of
writing”, marked “atow” in the listings), aka the length of the work, mostly
because it was trivial to do so. It’s much less trivial for other form factors,
so I didn’t keep track. Word counts and totals are at time of record. I don’t
keep track of how much I read in updates after the record, though by sampling
I estimate it hovers around an additional half a million words per month.</p>
<p>Historically, these reading archives were part of “monthly updates,” but during
the last migration of this website, I split all of it out. See the <a href="reading/../updates/index.html">Progress
Updates</a> section for the rest of it.</p>
<p>Bolded entries are “very good” and “recommended” though I will note all of them
were marked such at the time of record, and it’s unlikely I stand by these
recommendations in the present.</p>
<p>Fics are tagged by fandom, with various abbreviations. These should be more or
less obvious.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="2016-summary"><a class="header" href="#2016-summary">2016: summary</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>From the future (Sep 2021): that year I start keeping records, but they
weren’t detailed or really organised. However, in July I’d set out the list of
criteria that I would be using initially to select fics to read. Almost all of
these have gone, hah, save for the religion and “get good fast” ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="july-2016"><a class="header" href="#july-2016">July 2016</a></h1>
<p>For the past two months and a few weeks, I had given myself the challenge to
read all fics on <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-FFN-Graphs-Vis/pagerank/hp.html">this list of Harry Potter fanfics</a>, provided they met
my criteria and I hadn’t already read them, of course. My criteria went thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The fic has to be complete, unless it was updated recently.</strong> That was to
avoid abandoned fics. I was in this for many reasons, one of which was the
pleasure I get from reading good fics, and after the first few abandoned
fics I decided I couldn’t bear the disappointment anymore. If I had been
reading just a few of them, maybe I would have; but this was a hundred
fairly long fanfics — I couldn’t cope with potentially dozens of unfinished
plots, of having to leave characters I had gotten attached to without ever a
chance of seeing the conclusion of their story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The fic has to be good, fast.</strong> I set a hard limit at five chapters before
I would give up. I don’t think I ever hit it. This was a list of the <em>top</em>
100 fanfics, so not many were truly bad, but those that were clearly
announced themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The fic has to be in English.</strong> Obviously, if I can’t read it… Nevermind
that I can read French fluently, I don’t particularly <em>like</em> reading fanfics
in French. I also don’t like reading programming documentation in French,
and when I communicate with French developers, it is most often in English.
This is a personal thing. Only one fic hit that rule, but I had made it in
advance as I knew it was a possibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Dramione.</strong> As in, the Draco/Hermione romantic relationship pairing.
This was more subtle than that: with very few exceptions, I outright ignored
all fanfics that kept pretty much everything the same, but then forced the
characters into the ship. I don’t mind when Dramione, or something near it,
actually happens organically, as a true part of the fic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No sanctimonious religious bullshit.</strong> If you think atheists don’t
actually have morals because morals are exclusive to people who believe in a
giant cuddly Zeus lookalike who loves everyone so much he has them kill each
other for no fucking reason floating in the sky… yeah, not a fan. Or,
actually, as long as you keep that shit to yourself, all good. But don’t put
it in your fanfic like you’re a preacher yelling at the gay kids that
they’re all going to hell because, y’know, only straight love is allowed
past the gates of Paradise. There are fics like that in the list. Fuck ’em.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In fact, no bigotry.</strong> That’s an interestion criterion in a verse that has
a lot of the plot and underlying tensions about blood bigotry. But there is
a vast difference between bigotry, of any kind, being <em>explored</em> in the text
and the author trying to <em>push</em> their own bigotry through fanfic. There are
two very blatant opposites in this regard in the list: one had a protagonist
and winning side and even the losing side, in parts, be very much convinced
and fervent and <em>true</em> in their belief that Muggles were vermin… but the
author wasn’t a bigot. Or if they were, by some turn of luck, their fic at
least didn’t read like that. It read like a well-crafted exploration of a
concept, with realistic characters who were strong in their beliefs, even
though these were objectionable and horrible and wrong, and similarly for
the other side. The <em>other</em> fic… was very much racist. The characters on
the “wrong” side of the issue (according to the author) were weak and their
personalities were systematically twisted to fit the narrative; while the
bigoted rhetoric was dripping from even the narrator’s parts, not just the
characters’ thoughts. There was, totally unsurprisingly, also classic skin
and ethnic racism, and homo/trans-phobias. A smorgasbord of barely-subtle
hate delivered in the wrappings and trappings of a universe I love. It’s a
bitter experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Entries I found deserving were listed publicly on <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:passcod">my Pinboard</a>, along with
quick commentary. I tried to keep the comments spoiler-free in general, but
of course that’s difficult to do in this context.</p>
<p>I estimated the total amount of prose I’d read, just counting those HP fanfics,
at 15-20 million words. But who’s counting?</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, after a suitably long (ha ha, who am I kidding, I like fanfic too much to
leave it for long) break, I am starting the very same thing with the <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-FFN-Graphs-Vis/pagerank/naruto.html">Naruto
list</a>, from the same source. Same criteria, except of course the Dramione
clause — I think the Naruto verse doesn’t really have such a contentious
pairing. Naruto/Orochimaru comes to mind, but is not really any different from
Harry/Voldemort, and there are good fanfics with that. I think perhaps a
Mizuki/Naruto ship would qualify. One difference between the two verses is that
shinobi have little compunction against killing their foe, or dying trying,
which means that if two people who hate each other meet, it often ends up
bloody rather than them not being able to do much other than shouting at each
other or bullying them, and potentially-fatal encounters are not very conducive
to romance, of any kind. This isn’t Hollywood, kids, you’re not going to have
people who <em>say</em> they hate each other fuck each other silly after five minutes
on screen because of *hand waving* pent-up feelings and borderline porn.</p>
<p>We’ll see what comes of it.</p>

<p>There’s been two chapters of <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/tourist/">Tourist</a> this period, so naturally I’ve commented

is <a href="https://twitter.com/Wanderlustin">Saf</a>’s current serial novel about AI and asexuality and depression and it’s
great! Not only do I love her writing, I love the themes and the way she
explores them. There’s a few scenes which evoke a very particular feeling I’ve
experienced, and it’s fascinating that Saf is able to make me remember how that
feeling is like just through her words. The writing was perhaps a little
hesitant at first, but it’s been getting better and better every chapter. The
latest chapter is excellent.</p>

<p>Despite claiming, as is usual, that all belongs to Rowling, this fic really
only uses the characters and some general elements of plot. The universe is
one of the most original I have ever read. It is an utterly different world,
and extremely well built and detailed. Not content to be defined over a few
departure points, it is rich of several dozen centuries of history with a
particular focus, due to the story, around Europe, the British Isles, and the
Americas. But this world is dark and cruel and bleak, and that itself is a
terrible understatement. Content warnings for sexual and otherwise abuse,
exploitation, horror… and yet that feels like too little said. It is a very
good work. It surpasses many original, published, novels I have read in the
genre. But while it hooked me and wouldn’t let me go as I devoured it, each
further installment shook me deeper. Even with an active imagination and few
of the ‘moral’ blockers on thought most my peers have, this world and its
inhabitants shocked me in their depravity and casual evil, but most
importantly, in the way it showed every single cause and character as
believing they were in the right, even while performing and perpetuating
wickedness, resulting in institutionalised malevolence in every situation and
at every level of society. Even the heroes, the protagonists, the good ones,
those trying to quite literally save the world from itself, are merely
<em>questionably good</em> most of the time. It is a dark, dark work, but it is
very, very good. It’ll haunt me for a while. If you at all can, <strong>read it.</strong>

<p>Interesting format, with distinct arcs corresponding to Naruto’s missions
instead of a single continuity of plot. It makes the whole thing more
approachable, and sets clear expectations around the progression of a
particular writing stint. Unfinished, but not abandoned; there are long-term
plot lines still in suspens (and I’m not talking about the canon plot lurking
in the background, rather about the original plot lines that make it all
interesting). {370k words at time of writing}</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yet another marriage contract story. What can I say? I like
romance, and this is one of the most popular and least sappy romance genre in
this fandom. I found the basis for the story interesting, and the resolution
swift if perhaps a bit anti-climatic. But then again, the defeat of Voldemort
was never the focus of the plot. The fic brushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813949273528102912">some thoughts</a>
I had while reading, namely on the influence Harry’s near worship for a
decade, without having a real person to mellow it, would have had on society,
particularly regarding standards of appearance and, to a lesser extent,
behaviour. There was a strange consistent corruption to the spelling of some
words, almost as if the text had been OCR’d: notably, various ‘I’ or ‘i’
letters had been replaced with ‘1’, but not all of them. {165k words}</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern">Jbern</a> rarely disappoints. This was a fun story, but not a Humour story.
Typical plot of Individual!Harry going against Dumbledore, but various
atypical plot elements, mostly around making typically-always-good characters
have questionable morals and make less-than-Light decisions, and making
typically-always-evil characters be borderline good but forced in a bad
situation. It adds an interesting realism. Few bad points, but one in
particular (rot13): va gung lrf, gurer vf n cybg-rkphfr sbe ebznapr gb tb

planning and showing only the results. Including planning that actually feels

<p>This was really really good. I love Hermione time travel stories. I love when
all the characters have their own flame, their own passions and thoughts and
reasons and defects. I also really love stories that were planned out before
they were written, and written before they were published, as they are
invariably of better quality, simply due to having been revised and
cross-written. Contains graphic sex, but gentle and hot and furious and
<em>real</em>. Some scenes reminded me of sex I’ve had, see, that’s how good and
real it was. Also contains instances of graphic violence, but not gore, and
not deeply disturbing. It covers war (both of them) and terror and torture,
but it’s not meant to shock and disgust. If you read nothing else on this
list, I do recommend this one. {555k words}</p>

<p>This list is getting way too long, but fortunately we’re two days before this
update goes out and the next few fics I have queued are crackfics or
small-length fics, so they should all make it into the short format list
below. Well-written, and with a delightful amount of lesbian, gay, and bi
characters, all presented positively, little prejudice in this regard all
around. Also remarkably good with letting everyone be happy with their
various religions, while calling out cultural misappropriation. No trans or
enbies that I could find, but we’re getting there. Happy-ending fic,
even more so than the other happy-ending fics I’ve read recently; this is
positively Disney-esque in its epilogue. Although it’s certainly <em>not</em>
Disney-esque in its contents, with sex à gogo, lots of innuendo, etc. There’s
also violence and abuse present, this isn’t an all-rainbows fest. One
persistent bad point: the cavalier way horrific fates are dished onto some
antagonists. Sure, it might seem like karmic retribution, but cheerfully
finishing off Malfoy by having him be taken by <em>human traffickers intent on
forcing him into prostitution</em> still leaves a bad taste in. {520k words}</p>

<p>A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me <em>not</em> to write a Star Wars
× Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
potential the crossover’s universe has… many stories could have been written
within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers’
imagination. Rated T. {135k words}</p>

<p>Rated T but should have been M. Probably. This is Dune, but in the Star Wars
universe, with more sex and less Bene Gesserit. It does a good job of showing
the horror of the amount of lives lost during space conflict, when billions
of lives cry out in the Force, and it has an actual effect on those
sensitive. In the original six, there is a whole three minutes spent on the
destruction of a planet and millions of souls; two Jedi briefly look up and
say, almost deadpan, that they felt two billion souls die… and then they go
back to what they were doing, barely affected. In TFA, Starkiller Base
destroys five planets — there are no estimates I could find on the population
of the system, but let’s put it in the high dozen billions, maybe even half a
trillion — and there is even less effect on the Force-sensitive. Like, come
on! Billions have just died. At least show the Force-touched having a
<em>little</em> emotion here, maybe. So, in The Last Jedi, our protagonist Tobin, as
a youngling, witnesses the killing of “merely” thousands and feels it in the
Force, and it disturbs him so greatly that he has to isolate himself and cry
for hours at a time. A trained Jedi Knight is shown as losing control of her
emotions in violent manner. Even a less-monstrously-sensitive Mirakula is
strained and isolates herself, even while she has lived through dozens or
hundreds of such events already and could be thought to be inured against the
horror. Anyway, as you may see, I liked this fic a lot. {185k words}</p>

<p>Good story. The plots are thought-out and I really appreciate the insight
into other characters. The entire Chamber of Secrets episode, in particular,
is as much about Ginny and her struggle against Tom, than it is about Harry
and Sirius and friends… and then after that, the experience didn’t just
completely not matter, there are credible post-trauma effects, and the people
around don’t just forget what they’ve been through either. Last volume is
unfinished at time of writing, but updated recently. I’m hoping for a
Harry/Ginny ship but not holding my breath: there’s a lot of potential still.

experience. A summary would not do it justice. A description could not hope

edit down such that only what is needed remains. It all comes together in its
final chapter, triggering understanding over all the previous ones, but still
leaving us with that uncertainty Hermione hinted to at the Grimmauld party:
that you cannot really be sure it was all his work, or not. {90k words}</p>

Yes, this is a time travel fic. I like the way it’s written, and although

You know that quote about how grown-up fiction is about english professors
wondering about who to fuck, and YA fiction is about overthrowing the
government and picking up the pieces? This is grown-up YA fiction. The
government has been overthrown, the villains have been defeated, and there’s
still the shit attitudes in society that caused it all in the first place —
but we’re working on that. There’s peace. But it’s the picking up of pieces
that remains to be done. Recovering from all you’ve lived, and figuring out
where you’re going. Treating all the fucked up stuff you’ve done and that’s
still in your head. Talking to people. Getting angry and pissed off and
breaking up and making up and it all not being the literal end of the world.
Living life. And slowly getting there. {137k words}</p>

<p>Has complex plots without being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they’re used,
without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
time travel mechanisms I have ever read, over a year thrice folded on
itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in some other fics I
won’t cite where characters make plans and schemas and diagrams but there’s
only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and explained. And
even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn’t depend entirely
on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance planning, munchkinning,
and other techniques all combine together in an explosive mix, with no less
than three different plots going on at the same time… at any given time. And
that’s just the first book! The second book is ongoing, and I am loving it.

<p>This is brilliant. Also fun and humourous and just the right amount of
flirty. Long chapters, lots of action: physical, verbal, and otherwise.
There’s a very hot dominant sex scene right at the start of the second
chapter, preceded (at the end of the first) by a bunch of realistic in-public
affection and… more. It’s honestly refreshing, after decidedly adult fics
that nevertheless ellide any actual action, and a wide corpus of fics that
deal with more or less horny teenagers instead of mature (<em>cough</em> as if
<em>cough</em>) young adults. Ongoing. {60k words atow}</p>

<p>I love the perspective into and out of all the characters, especially Ahsoka
and Aayla. The analysis and conflicting opinions of power structures with the
Galaxy by an outsider that still has considerable experience that is more or
less relatable, and by insider people both accepted and excluded from those
same structures, yields interesting discussions packed with details. The “too
many assumptions” thing resonated particularly with me, as it is something I
struggle with when interacting with some people I know (they make assumptions
that are often wrong or incomplete and draw concludions from that, without
ever pausing to ask themselves or others about them, and end up making wild
accusations that are hard to defend upon on the spot (and they then take that
hesitation as admission of guilt, instead of confusion or trying to organise
thoughts) as I need to think about what their assumptions could be that they
end up there; the entire exercise is very frustrating). There are spectacular
scenes of magic and action, the forces involved are of epic proportions, and
yet humour both by characters and by story is pervasive. It’s a good mix.

<p>It starts like any other teenager romance… well, the troubled ones anyway.
Girl runs away from home, boy runs away from life, they meet and fall into
friendship first, and then into love. But the likeness stops here. Because
this is a Harry Potter story, and that means heartbreak, it means danger, it
means terror, it means conflict and drama and emotions running high in all
directions. It means magic, and all the problems that brings with it. It
means love. And so <em>Behind Blue Eyes</em> finishes like few other adult romances…
with pain and loss and success and that particular kind of happiness that is
like the flame of a phoenix: strong and bright, reborn many times, and
fiercely everlasting. {440k words}</p>

<p>And then I started earnestly into writing my fanfic, and predictably, I got to
reading lots more Star Wars fics. Official pretext for this is “gotta find
voices and get into the feel for writing my characters” but of course the plots
and cuties are why I stay.</p>
<p>But seriously, encountering characters I’m writing and have been thinking about
for the past few months in other fanfics is pretty cool. It really lets me
figure out the edges of my characters, and think about behaviour/personality
for more than just the obvious by comparing against what I’m reading. And when
something really clashes, I have to think and mentally point out details that
justify why I feel like the characterisation is wrong.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a few fics-with-Rey below that have her as a sociable
lovable figure who trusts people easily, like, what??? No. She’s been a
scavenger for fifteen years, she’s canonically been betrayed by people she
thought were her peers fairly early on, she lived alone for ages, she was
exploited by adults around her until she got strong enough to fuck off on her
own, one of the only beings who halfway protected her and gave her the
opportunity to earn for the past ten years called the Empire on her (<em>this is
portrayed somewhat differently in the novelisations, but while the details
change a bit, the broad strokes remain the same</em>) at the drop of a hat. She’s
not going to be a bubbly extrovert now. What is wrong with you.</p>

<p>I’m going on a strong Star Wars (all eras confounded) bender. I avoid Kylo/Rey
(extra ew) and Kylo/Hux fics because ew, and I like time travel fix-it fics.
Mostly I’ve been impressed at the depth and breadth of the verses crafted, and
the large currency held by Queer-abundant fics. It “makes sense” to have
genderqueer and varied sexualities in a universe where there’s several dozen
<em>species</em> cohabiting with each other, among a few <em>thousand</em> worlds (sometimes
the scale of it all boggles the mind), but it’s heartwarming every time.</p>
<p>I’ll certainly be adding a bunch of references and homages to some of the best
fics out there into <em>my</em> fic, mostly in passing-by references to names and
places. If you’ve been in the fanficdom, you should be able to pick out a few!</p>
<p>Something that’s been interesting to notice is fics and authors that were
influenced by the Re-Entry fanfic epic. You see, in Canon (and Legends)
Coruscant has a 24-hour day. In the Re-Entry fanon, though, Coruscant has a
26-hour day. Well, in many non-Re-Entry fics that should AU from Canon or
Legends, and that state it as such, you get mentions of “25th hour” or “there
isn’t more than 26 hours in the day” while in the Coruscanti Jedi Temple (or
elsewhere on planet)!</p>

<p>{SW} <strong><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/392674">More Than Our Makers Intended</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Excellent fic both in the romance/ship side and in the PTSD side. Notably,
<em>actually gets</em> that Rey comes from a desert-world where water is precious
and food was scarce and she is used to work and also not used to have food be
guaranteed. Similarly, that Finn was a trooper in an extremely harsh and
conditioned army, where even trivial-for-bacta medical issues were more often
than not resolved with blaster-aided disappearances. Also great at non-binary
and queer genders and sexualities in a wider universe without making it be a
super minor discreet story element (like some novels do, like they want to
have it but also are afraid to bring it front and center). {26k + 26k + 4k

<p>Well-written, really, and has good emotions… I would have liked Rogue One to

<p>{SW} <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/10129274">Back From the Future: Episode IV The Clone Wars</a>.</p>
<p>Has a fairly unique narrative style and form that I’m going to liberally
borrow from, and not just because it seems tailor-made for my style and
cadence of writing. I had been despairing of the glueing work I’d have to do
to make my fic work, and the rewriting of scenes to comply with One
Narrative, but this is much better. Story-wise, this is well done, both in
plot that is organised and yet still surprising, in style which is “crack
that takes itself seriously” and manages that perfectly, in humour both
wordplay and plot irony and situational, in character development as well as
characters stubbornly refusing to change, for good and bad. {107k words}</p>

<p>{LotR} <strong><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/855528">Sansûkh</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another incredible epic fanfic. I really like both the concept and the
execution, and have healthy respect for the huge amounts of research and
outright creation that must have gone into it. The character growth shown and
told for everyone involved is first-rate. The use of Sindarin and Khuzdul is
appropriate and not overbearing, which is very well done indeed. And the
language style itself, that manner of speaking… I love that. (Also the
massive amounts of recursive fanart displayed throughout is both heartening
and frankly quite cute.) <em>AND DID I MENTION the vast diversity of cast!</em>
Gay/bi are merely common, colour is varying and fine, neuro-atypicals are
well-represented, and a/bi/trans-gender characters! That’s right, with a
plural! Not just two, either. Now <em>that</em>’s greatness. {518k words atow}</p>

<p>Found and binged <a href="http://www.wildelifecomic.com">Wilde Life</a>, about a kind?
lost? man running from his old life to a tiny town in Oklahoma… only to find
himself embroiled into the affairs of a typical teenager who’s also a werewolf,
at least three witches, talking animals, asshole bears, and the odd ghost or
two. It’s beautifully drawn, cute and amusing and seriously good.</p>

<p>Apparently I’m trying to read the entire Star Wars fanficdom on AO3. Or at
least, those that catch my eye in the listings. Still firmly avoiding certain
eww pairings. Briefly dipped into Thor fics as well. A lot of (delicious) NSFW.</p>

<p>One of the best fics I’ve read this month, perhaps even <em>the</em> best. It is
very much a rationalist fic, where not only the world is constructed in a
rational manner, but the characters are shown to think and behave according
to complex <em>reason</em> rather than just whatever the author needed to happen at
this point in time. (A work that does only the former is called a “rational”
fic, which is too subtle a word difference I think.) Does enough original
worldbuilding that it can get where it wants, without overwhelming the
story, even though one can just <em>see</em> the author could happily write an
entire volume about their own part and culture of the world rather than
stick to the Star Wars locations and stories. A+, would recommend. {15k +

<p>That was delightful. While the disappearance of Harry isn’t yet resolved, and
honestly at this point feels a bit too much like a convenient way to get the
main plot out of the way so we can explore Nizar’s in peace, <em>I really don’t
mind</em>. Nizar — and the story — is sweet and quietly humourous. Heartily

<p>Set in the Harry Potter verse, but ten years after Voldie’s death, and set in
America. Does not really mention Britain or Harry or any of them. Besides the
story itself, which is excellent, the context of wizarding prejudices and
house-elves within the wider context of America’s deep history and current
affairs with racism, corruption, police/authority violence and routine
violation of the very laws they are supposed to defend, paints a chilling
universe that left me uneasy throughout my read. On top of that, the quiet
horror of schooling practices that reflects, no doubt, their non-magical
counterparts in our reality only serves to reinforce the idea that there is
something fundamentally <em>wrong</em> with that country, and magic does not help.
A recommended read, albeit with warnings. {166k + 235k + 204k + 262k words}</p>

<p>{HP} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311">A Long Journey Home</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The premise is the most interesting I’ve read in a while, even in the already
crowded genre of time travel, and even counting time travel closing-the-loop
fics of the same order of magnitude on the time scale. Which, by the way,
another very good fic which comes close to the premise and scale is one
recommended last month, the <em>Of a Linear Circle</em> series.</p>
<p>However, <em>A Long Journey Home</em> shines by its radically different
story-telling, a sequence of extended vignettes in the long life of one
Jasmine Potter, showing many stories and histories, each standing alone with
grace and yet much richer for its part in the whole. The theories and
explorations its characters go through, both personally and of magic, are
rendered beautifully and yet without glamouring or wonderwashing, and without
the praise-science-preach-science approach of ‘conventional’ rationalist
fiction.</p>
<p>And yes, this <em>is</em> rationalist fiction, but embedded in great writing as an
integral part of the work, instead of using the work as a mere transport.

<p>This is an excellent fic, if very graphic given its premise and content.
There is little that I dislike about it: most of that is the lack of
proofreading consistent throughout. It’s not badly written, but there’s words
missing, awkward wording, common typos, etc. The story is well-organised into
arcs and subarcs and side-stories, with very good blending and threading so
while you can see the different arcs, they don’t feel disjointed at all. The
principles that the Jedi are orienting themselves towards is also a great
boon to me, as it is exactly the kind of thing one group in my Dawnverse is
going for, so it’s giving me both confirmation and ideas on how to write it.
Heartily recommend, albeit with warnings for very graphic violence and abuse.

<p>I’m running out of nice things to say about fics. Assume the details: it’s a
great fic, well-written, good arcs, awesome concept, etc. What I found really
interesting about it is the point of view of people under an authoritarian
regime. There’s not much by people who enjoy serving under it, and not much
by people who resist, although there’s a bit of both. No, what’s there most
is people who believe they’re doing the right thing, for very good reasons,
who are <em>loyal</em> to the regime, when they really really shouldn’t be. There’s
people destroying themselves to survive, at any cost. It’s a story about
shades of people operating in a shady world where no circumstance, no
decision, is ever black and white, right or wrong, wholly good or wholly
evil. It’s a convincing and chilling perspective, especially here, today.

<p>There are many good fanfictions, and many good books, but there are few great
ones. This is one of them. Like many, it was written over a long time,
refined and cultivated. It marries story, originality, and emotion in one big
happy polyamorous family, and the climaxes are exhalting if terribly shaking.
And of course, nothing is a coincidence, and everything is fucking poetry. A
delight. {117k words}</p>

<p>Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don’t include fics I read but didn’t like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn’t include all
I read that <em>wasn’t</em> fanfic (yet, but I’m working on that for next year!).</p>
<p>After doing some sampling during the year, I have measured that I read about
120k words of fanfic <em>updates</em> per <em>week</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2017 → January 2018: 2,204k</li>
<li>January → February: 2,090k</li>
<li>February → March: 62k</li>
<li>March → April: 779k</li>
<li>April → May: 1,099k</li>

<p>I made a commitment to not start reading <em>as many</em> fanfics this year, instead
going for (an overabundance of) physical books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the future (Sep 2021): yeeah… that didn’t pan out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m still reading some, though.</p>

I really really love this Draco. I also love the brand of humour, especially in the early books. It has lots of OCs, which can be offputting at first but works out well. A negative is that there are many many words that or not just badly spelt, but the wrong word altogether, only it <em>sounds like the right word</em>. My hypothesis is the author is slightly dyslexic, but who knows. That can cause some pause in the reading, but the reading is worth it. {585k words}</li>

<p>I think I’ve finally closed off the fanfic-devouring void in my heart. Now it’s
more like a trickle. I’m slowly finishing off a list of good fics I’d saved up
“for later” and I’m not adding any, so eventually I’ll get to Fanfic Zero.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m still reading the updates as they come through. Through random
sampling, I’ve estimated I read about 120k words of fanfic updates per week.</p>

<h2 id="fanfic-2"><a class="header" href="#fanfic-2">Fanfic</a></h2>
<p>Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don’t include fics I read but didn’t like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow.</p>
<p>This year instead of updating in the mid month, I updated at the end of each
month, so the month’s total is really for <em>that month</em>, rather than staggered.</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2018 → January 2019: 1,536k</li>

As of writing, this is the longest complete fic on AO3, of any fandom. Bulk of it read in
3 weeks between January and February, then the (much less enjoyable) sequel and epilogue
later in the year. Not recommended reading, except for bragging rights. Even with a happy
ending, it’s quite dark, extremely graphic, and oftimes gratuitous with its violence.
It also has <em>way</em> too many lemons. You wouldn’t think that’s possible, but quod erat demonstratum.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0071">Time 0.1 and 0.2 have a security notice</a> about use of the <code>localtime_r</code>
libc function, and <a href="https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159">Chrono has a related notice</a>, both issued in November 2020.
While <a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293">Time has a mitigation in place</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/499">Chrono doesn’t and doesn’t plan to</a>.
The security issue is very specific and can be mitigated through your own efforts; there’s also some
controversy on if it is an issue at all. The Time crate has evolved a lot in the past few years and
its 0.3 release has a lot of APIs that Chrono is used for; thus it is possible for many, but not
all, Chrono users to switch to Time 0.3; this could have some additional benefit.</p>

<h3 id="localtime_r-and-setenv"><a class="header" href="#localtime_r-and-setenv"><code>localtime_r</code> and <code>setenv</code></a></h3>
<p>From the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/core/man-pages/localtime_r.3.en">manpage</a>, edited for length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>localtime_r()</code> function converts the calendar time <code>timep</code> to broken-down time
representation, expressed relative to the user’s specified timezone. The function acts as if it
called <code>tzset(3)</code> and provides information about the current timezone, the difference between
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local standard time in seconds, and whether daylight savings
time rules apply during some part of the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/core/man-pages/setenv.3.en">setenv</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…adds the variable <code>name</code> to the environment with the value <code>value</code>…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue occurs when the environment of a program is modified (chiefly with <code>setenv</code>) at the same
time that <code>localtime_r</code> is used; in those cases, a segfault may be observed.</p>
<p><code>localtime_r</code> is a fairly complex beast, which interfaces with the system’s timezone files and
settings to provide localtime information and conversion. It is a very useful function that is used
pretty much everywhere that needs to interact with local/utc time and timezones. Handling timezones
is largely regarded as all programmers’ bane; replacing this function with one that does not have
the behaviour is a <a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293#issuecomment-909009716">potentially massive endeavour</a>. Over on IRLO, Tony Arcieri
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/synchronized-ffi-access-to-posix-environment-variable-functions/15475">provides a summary of the Rust side of this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Time has mitigated the issue by removing the calls to <code>localtime_r</code>, returning errors in 0.2 and 0.3
<a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/blame/4eebedd48c505fb7b042ad8aff8ad7665c5545ed/src/utc_offset.rs#L330-L332">unless a custom <code>cfg</code> is passed to the compiler</a>. That does mean that if you
<em>do</em> want that information, you’re out of luck unless you (as an application) or all your end-users
(as a library) enable that custom configuration.</p>
<h3 id="the-counter-view"><a class="header" href="#the-counter-view">The counter view</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RichFelker/status/1450300830381445121">Rich Felker (author of musl) has another view.</a> He argues that the issue is not in
calling the <code>localtime_r</code> function, but in modifying the environment. The environment ought to be
immutable, and it is somewhat well known in other large projects that the footgun exists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/34726#issuecomment-584727732">In the Julia language, also featuring Felker</a></li>

<li><a href="https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=188">In the POSIX standard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue is even known to the Rust project, with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24741">a documentation PR in 2015(!) adding cautionary
language to the <code>std::env::set_var</code> function</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t have nearly the same amount of knowledge in this issue, but for the record, and despite the
sections below, I do <em>agree</em> with the view that the environment should be considered read-only.
Perhaps a clippy lint could be added.</p>
<h2 id="replacing-chrono"><a class="header" href="#replacing-chrono">Replacing Chrono</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of the previous discussion, there are other issues around usage of Chrono.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-pains"><a class="header" href="#chronic-pains">Chronic pains</a></h3>
<p>Its last release at writing, 0.4.19, was <a href="https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.19">more than a year ago</a>. Issues are piling
up. It’s still on edition 2015 (which to be clear isn’t really an issue, but more of an indicator).</p>
<p>It could just be that the crate is considered finished (the docs <em>do</em> describe it as
“feature-complete”).</p>
<p>Or it may be that maintainers have mostly checked out. (No fault on the maintainers! I’ve done the
same with Notify, once.)</p>
<p>If you’re fine with this, and you’re confident that you (and your dependencies) aren’t writing to
the environment, then you can keep on using Chrono. There is, however, a viable alternative now:</p>
<h3 id="time-03"><a class="header" href="#time-03">Time 0.3</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#030-2021-07-30">Time’s 0.3 release adds many APIs</a>, which cover a large amount of the surface that Chrono
is used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>No-alloc mode</li>
<li>The <code>Month</code> type</li>
<li>Calendar/Ordinal/ISO/Julian conversions</li>
<li>Large dates (beyond +/- 9999 years)</li>
<li>Parsing and serde support</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some features which are only supported by newer Time, not by Chrono:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>const</code> functions</li>
<li>the <code>datetime!</code> macro for constructing datetimes at compile-time</li>
<li>Serialising non-ISO8601 representations</li>
<li>Random dates/times</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/quickcheck">QuickCheck</a> support</li>

<blockquote>
<p>8 August 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last month I dove into <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> after discovering it more than a year ago but never having the excuse
to really get stuck into it. Last month I got two different opportunities, and used it for both: an
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install/autoinstall-reference">autoinstall template for Ubuntu 20.04</a>, and a Kubernetes config template for very
similar containers that each needed a pod and a service just to vary one or two settings.</p>
<p>While Dhall is good at what it does, despite many rough edges, as I progressed I realised it’s
really not what I want.</p>
<h2 id="what-dhall-does-well"><a class="header" href="#what-dhall-does-well">What Dhall does well</a></h2>
<p><strong>Types.</strong> Dhall is fully typed in the Haskell fashion, and every Dhall document is an expression,
which contains types or values, or trees of types and trees of values. Dhall does structural typing,
so two types <code>A = { an: Integer }</code> and <code>B = { an: Integer }</code> are actually the <em>same</em> type.</p>
<p><strong>Safety.</strong> Dhall is strictly non-Turing-complete, and most notably is guaranteed to complete (no
halting problem here). Functions have no side effects, and while input can be done from files, the
environment, and remote URLs (!), output is only through whatever structure is left at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Reproducibility.</strong> Dhall includes concepts and tools that can enforce the integrity of imports,
and verify that one expression is equivalent to another, such that you can refactor how that
expression is constructed and authoritatively assert that your refactor is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Library.</strong> As an established project, there are libraries that are built up for various projects,
such as for Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, GitHub actions, OpenSSL, Ansible… additionally, the
built-in function and keyword set is very small, so everything is accessible, inspectable, etc.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-found-it-lacking"><a class="header" href="#where-i-found-it-lacking">Where I found it lacking</a></h2>
<p><strong>Errors.</strong> Good erroring is hard, I’ll acknowledge. Dhall erroring isn’t <em>terrible</em>… but it’s
often obscure and mislaid me many times. Dhall often stops at the first error, which might be a
<em>consequence</em> or a <em>symptom</em> of the actual mistake, and gaining that visiblity is hard.</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity.</strong> and layperson-friendliness. Is basically zero. Dhall errors require familiarity
with Dhall errors: they’re not very approachable unless you’re already familiar with them. Dhall
itself is foreign at times, and some of its syntax quirks are downright baffling (in one pet peeve,
it bills itself as whitespace insensitive, but what it really means is that as long as whitespace is
in the right place, it doesn’t care what that whitespace <em>is</em>… but <code>a(b c)</code> is still different to
<code>a (b c)</code>, to hilariously-hard-to-debug effects.) While I can use Ruby, Rust, and advanced Bash in
work projects, I would <em>never</em> use Dhall because it would add more barriers than it adds value.</p>
<p><strong>Inconsistency.</strong> For a language with a tiny built-in library, it’s quite surprising. Everything in
Dhall is an expression… except some things that look like expressions but aren’t (like the <code>merge</code>
keyword). The whitespace thing. Imports get an optional argument for a checksum, something that
<em>nothing else</em> can do (no optional or default arguments, though the record pattern approximates some
of it). Some things are keywords, some things are symbols, and some things are nothing at all, with
little rhyme or reason. It makes hard to develop intuition.</p>
<p><strong>Information loss.</strong> There’s a bug open for at least three years where the <em>formatting</em> tools of
Dhall will silently erase all comments except those at the top of a file. Dhall is bad at respecting
ordering. This is surprising for a configuration tool: while the consuming application might not
care, order can be very important for <em>humans</em>. Some tools may even interpret ordering, for example
overriding earlier identical keys in a JSON map, or keeping the first one, and re-ordering may
actually change meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Inference.</strong> Because Dhall does structural typing with named and anonymous members, and because it
has no generics, there’s many situations where it <em>knows</em> the type of something, but will refuse to
compile unless you explicit it, which can be very repetitive and/or require refactorings to put a
name on a previously-anonymous type.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance or extensibility.</strong> While I <em>like</em> the lack of class-based inheritance in
<em>programming</em> languages like Rust and instead embrace the wrapping and trait and composition types
concepts, <em>configuration</em> is a different space. It’s not uncommon for a configuration schema to have
a general shape for a stanza that is specialised in many different variants, and representing that
in Dhall is painful, repetitive, or both.</p>
<p><strong>Translation.</strong> Somewhat related or an alternative to the above. Dhall makes it easy to create
type-friendly structures, but offers little to translate those structures back into what the actual
consumer expects. This ranges from key/value translation, where a Dhall-idiomatic spelling would be
<code>StorageKind</code> but the configuration requires <code>storage-kind</code>, to flattening, where you could express
a structure as a <code>Action&lt;Specifics&gt;</code> where <code>Action</code> has a type and id, and <code>Specifics</code> is an
enum/union for <code>AddPartition</code> or <code>WriteFilesystem</code> but the required structure has type and ids and
all specific properties on the same level, to different translations for different outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Postel’s Law.</strong> Or robustness principle. The one that goes “Be conservative in what you do, be
liberal in what you accept from others.” Dhall is conservative in what it does, certainly, and also
very strict in what it accepts. This would not be so much a problem if the tooling/erroring was
better: JSON can also be said to be strict on the input, and tooling exists that will point to where
the error is quite precisely; YAML can be said to be quite lax, and may silently do the wrong thing.
Dhall, however, doesn’t improve one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 December 2013</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year or so ago, I started getting interested in two new, modern systems programming languages: <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>. After playing around a bit with both, I chose <strong>Go</strong> to program a few things I had floating around at the time: <a href="https://github.com/passcod/plong-server">plong</a>, a pseudo-p2p server which is essentially a WebSocket relay and signaling server; <a href="https://github.com/passcod/poele">poële</a>, a very simple queue / task processor using Redis; and <a href="https://github.com/passcod/double-map">double-map</a>, a new kind of data-structure which solves the problem of slow hashmap search for specific scenarios.</p>
<p>Enthused by my success with a fast, modern, typed, compiled, systems language, I started having ideas of more ambitious things: <strong>imaku-latte</strong> was about a novel DE/WM for X11, <strong>thesides</strong> was about an EC2-like service for micro tasks and scripts.</p>
<p>More recently, <strong>aldaron</strong> is a tree editor, and <strong>pippo</strong> is my long-standing attempt at designing an ever-better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbms">DBMS</a> (current features include graphs, content-addressable low-level block store, powerful abstraction capabilities, transparent versioning and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">COW</a>, stream writes, and being truly distributed).</p>
<p><strong>thesides</strong> died for various reasons. The others didn’t, really, they were aborted and/or infinitely delayed because Go is too high level. It doesn’t allow easy low-level memory manipulation, the C interface is annoying both ways, and other nitpicks.</p>
<p>I still like Go, but I think I’m going to try out Rust for these projects where low-level access, where a real C replacement, is needed. We’ll see how that goes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 November 2013</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, and many other websites, long answers are cut off with a “(more)” button/link which immediately displays the rest of the answer in-place. The cut-off threshold seems to be a hard limit on words or characters. Sometimes it works:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qTo4xiS.png" alt="Answer #1 cut off" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XIXtSjs.png" alt="Answer #1 expanded, at least another page of content" /></p>
<p>Sometimes it seems a bit silly to just hide this little content:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ZCCZde.png" alt="Answer #2 cut off" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2s4bKQp.png" alt="Answer #2 expanded, only ~100px have been added" /></p>
<hr />
<p>I think there is a way to make this better:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use height, not length.</strong> Especially in this context! Length only has meaning if it is directly correlated to height, as is the case with block of text without breaks. Images make the height grow by a huge factor, as a link only a few dozen characters long can add hundreds of pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a soft limit.</strong> Instead of cutting at a hard, say, 800px, put an error margin on there, say ±100px. Thus, if the content is 850px high, don’t cut it off, but if it is 1000px high, do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make cuts more meaningful.</strong> Given the above rule, consider this: the cut-off is at 800±100px, and the content height is 905px. In this case, the cut-off would be at 800px, leaving a measly 105px below the fold. Avoid situations like this by moving the cut-off to make below-the-fold content more meaningful, e.g. at least 250px. Here, we would have a final cut-off at 655px.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“But computing height is difficult server-side, and we don’t want to do it client-side!”</strong> No it’s not. You don’t need to render the page to calculate height. Yes, it’s more precise, but you can estimate it fairly easily, especially if you have good control over your styles.</p>
<p>For text: you know what your font-size is. You have a good amount of content so you can easily compute (once!) the average number of words per line. You can easily count the number of line breaks and line rules. Thus you can quickly estimate the total text height.</p>
<p>For images: either take the same route and compute (once) the average height of images, or compute it per-image (maybe you host images, and create thumbs + metadata to be able to optimise loading times; in that case you could put the image height straight from your own service).</p>
<p>Combining both, you can obtain an estimate of the content height of any given article or text, and apply cut-offs then. And of course, the results can be cached!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Screenshots are from <a href="http://www.quora.com/Countries/What-do-you-think-every-foreigner-should-know-about-your-country">this Quora article</a>, which you should really have a look at, at least just for the beautiful images of the world.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 June 2014</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preface, of a sort, by mako himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, there was a circle of artists and wizards. The convocation called itself #Merveilles.</p>
<p>For a long time, most of the members of the cadre could be distinguished only by their names. The most connected among them took on varied faces of animals, but they were only a few.</p>
<p>One day, a faun arrived at the convocation. Lamenting that so many of its members looked exactly the same, it decided to use its <em>wild generative majykks</em> to weave a spell that would illuminate all members of the circle equally.</p>
<p>By the name of the subject, the majic would produce a number.</p>
<p>By that number, it would resolve a face.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://syhexgen.makopool.com">so</a> <a href="http://makopool.com/showBoard.html">it</a> <a href="http://merveill.es/">did</a>.</p>
<p>The faun’s enchantment brought joy to the circle, and for a time, it was good.</p>
<p>Many moons later, the faun, reviewing its work, realized that the m4g1kz it had cast had an imperfection. It was struck with a vision of the eventual coming of a strange being.</p>
<p>By the name of that devil, the mædʒIkz would produce <strong>6</strong> <strong>6</strong> <strong>6</strong></p>
<p>From 666, it would resolve <strong>no face at all</strong></p>
<p>Hearing the prognostication, a few set out in search of the name of the devil who hath no face, so that they may take it for their own. This is where our story begins…</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On the 3rd of June — it was Tuesday — <a href="http://makopool.com/">mako</a> gave me an interesting challenge. He’d been trying for a while now to get me into a particular community, but this is what actually brought me over:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: If you ever decide to introduce yourself to #merveilles, find a name that hashes to 666 according to the following</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">String.prototype.hashCode = function(){
		var hash = 0, i, char;
		if (this.length == 0) return hash;
		for (var i = 0, l = this.length; i &lt; l; i++) {
				char  = this.charCodeAt(i);
				hash  = ((hash&lt;&lt;5)-hash)+char;
				hash |= 0; // Convert to 32bit integer
		}
		return hash;
};
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: It’ll resolve to a BLANK ICON. Nobody else will have one. It will be eerie and awesome.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh. Well, okay.</p>
<p>I queried for the exact parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be between 1 and 30 characters.</li>
<li>It has to be ascii. Actually, the exact alphabet is <code>qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM1234567890_-\[]{}\</code>^|`.</li>
<li>It has to hash down to exactly 666.</li>
</ul>
<p>After briefly considering a reverse-engineering approach, I created <a href="https://github.com/passcod/merhash/blob/master/merhash.js">a quick prototype in NodeJS</a> to bruteforce the hash using sequential strings. I set it to run, but noticed pretty quickly (i.e. my desktop environment crashed) that it was using too much memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: I’ve brute-forced the hash up to 4chars and ~50% of 5chars, and node ate up nearly 2Gb of swap in under a minute. Now I’m considering rewording it in rust to have memory guarantees ;)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After looking around the web (turns out that googling “NodeJS uses too much memory” returns a lot of garbage), I found <a href="https://github.com/passcod/merhash/blob/master/merhash.js#L20-L23">a partial solution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: I’m forcing gc in node every 1000 tries, and it’s slowed down the memory uptake, but it’s still rising and about 1% (of 4G) every 20s :(</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly that wasn’t the right way. Still, I persevered, switching my method to use “the <em>bogo</em> approach”: generating random strings of random length. The memory usage was still insane, but I hoped to have enough data in a short while to do some analysing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: Right, after 2 million hashes taken from random strings of random(1..20) length, the <em>only</em> ones that have three characters {sic, I meant digits} are single chars. These obviously don’t go as high as 666.</li>
<li>{ passcod }: I conclude it’s either rare or impossible</li>
<li>{ mako }: I wont feel comfortable until we can conclude it’s impossible. As far as we know, the devil is still out there, hiding.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, mako decided to <a href="https://github.com/passcod/merhash/blob/master/merhash.cpp">write one in C++</a>. Meanwhile, I wondered about outside-the-square solutions: maybe this supported UTF-8! Nope:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: No unicode allowed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh well. Dinner awaited.</p>
<hr />
<p>That evening, I got back to mako finding C++ less than unyielding:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: I almost just caused an access violation.</li>
<li>{ mako }: Already blowing my fingers off.</li>
<li>{ mako }: Arg, exposing raw pointers. I’m so out of practice.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of curiosity and a stray “There must be a better way” thought, I started implementing it in Rust. Ninety minutes later, I had this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod random {
  use std::string::String;
  use std::rand;
  use std::rand::Rng;

  fn chr() -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;u8&gt; {
    let alphabet = bytes!("qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM1234567890_-[]{}^|\\`");
    rand::task_rng().choose(alphabet)
  }

  pub fn string(len: uint) -&gt; String {
    let mut result = String::with_capacity(len);
    for _ in range(0, len) {
      result.push_char(match chr() {
        Some(c) =&gt; *c,
        None =&gt; 48 as u8
      } as char);
    }
    result
  }
}

fn hash_code(input: &amp;String) -&gt; i32 {
  let mut hash: i32 = 0;
  if input.len() == 0 {
    0
  } else {
    for c in input.as_slice().chars() {
      hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) - hash) + (c as i32);
      hash |= 0;
    }
    hash
  }
}

fn main() {
  let strg = random::string(4);
  let hash = hash_code(&amp;strg);
  println!("{}: {}", strg, hash)
}</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: Mostly written because when you gave your C++, I realised I couldn’t read C++</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I started by benchmarking it against the Node version, and found that it was 3x faster unoptimised, ~10x optimised, and had constant memory usage. A definite improvement!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: 200,000 iter/s</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I attempted to make it multi-threaded, but benched it to be 2-3x slower (probably my fault, not Rust’s). It didn’t matter, though, as the <em>bogo</em> approach meant I could run two instances of the program with no semantic difference than doing it with threads.</p>
<p>It was getting late, so I used a combination of <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/t">t</a> and bash scripting to let it run on my Linode VPS during the night and have it tweet me if it found anything.</p>
<p>And then it was sleep tiem.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the morning, I woke up to two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I got onto Hangouts and found via mako that “Wally”, a #merveilles member (I think?), had jumped on board and was using a multi-threaded approach on peh’s 8-core machine. Things were getting serious.
I enquired about his hashing speed (I admit I was starting to be quite proud of myself at this moment), and mentioned that at the rate I was going, I would have computed about 4 billion hashes up ’til then.</li>
<li>I checked Twitter about 15 minutes later, and discovered that my agitation was, really, unwarranted:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: I’ve got it</li>
<li>{ passcod }: I’ve got TWO</li>
<li>{ mako }: Dear god.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn’t look good, though, ascii barf more than anything: <code>8XKf2WAkny|CFAZi_vQn</code> and <code>LcBqgVVPOSEkdIB7BZlVO</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: OH. We could even use my godname generator.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mako’s current occupation is developing a “platform for encouraging writers to explore a new format for fiction and collaborative world-building.” The mentioned <a href="https://github.com/passcod/merhash/blob/master/godname.scala">godname generator</a> creates a random, pronounceable name with a music that is quite particular, like “sonoellus” or “tsaleusos” or “thoruh” or “seposh”.</p>
<p>It uses weightings for each letter, which is fine for one-off name creation, but too time-consuming for my brute-forcing purposes, so I discarded that part. I measured <a href="https://github.com/passcod/merhash/blob/master/godname.rs">my implementation</a> to be generating 64k names per second on my machine, which wasn’t too bad. Slower than pure random, but that was expected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I decided to go have a look on #merveilles, and used the second name I got as a nick. I got mistaken as a bot! and just as I was about to give some pointers as to why my name was so weird, the connection dropped:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LcBqgVVPOSEkdIB7BZlVO has quit (Client Quit)
&lt; Preston &gt; NOOO the mystery</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wednesday afternoon, “Wally” gave up. That was a bit relaxing, although the competition was interesting.</p>
<hr />
<!-- ![A sheet of the icons that hash is used to produce](hexicon-facesheet.png) -->
<p><em>Each one of these icons was produced using an int32 seed. The 666 seed produces a blank icon.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Wednesday evening, I had a good implementation but previous results told me to only expect an answer after five days of computation. I wondered about alternatives:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: I’m half tempted to buy a few hours of highcpu AWS compute power and get it done nowish instead</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After a bit of research, I decided to just go for it. I set myself a $50 spending limit, which gave me about 24 hours of compute on an instance with 32 virtual cores, each about as powerful as one of my Linode’s cores.</p>
<p>I set it to run with 31 merhash programs running in parallel:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4I6qY7x.png" alt="31 cores being used fully" /></p>
<p>And went comatose again.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ mako }: That was the best sleep I’ve had in a while.</li>
<li>{ passcod }: Well, godname 666 is not looking good.</li>
<li>{ mako }: Nothing ?</li>
<li>{ passcod }: I got a cumulative 16 billion godnames generated and hashed, and nothing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>Investigating further, I realised I had made a few mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had set the random length generator wrong, and generated <em>only</em> 30-char-long godnames.</li>
<li>There was a bug in my implementation where the godname algorithm would get stuck in an infinite loop producing nothing.</li>
<li>My result collecting technique was sub-par.</li>
</ul>
<p>After getting back from class, I set upon fixing those, which took about an hour, and I now had about 10 remaining hours of compute time. I also made an improvement to improve the yield:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>{ passcod }: Also I’ve modified it so each instance appends any result it finds to a file and continues running.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I also created two versions of the program: one with godnames, the other with a reduced-alphabet random string generator, in the hopes of still getting readable names. I set both to run on 15 cores each.</p>
<p>And I waited.</p>
<hr />
<p>After just above 4 billion hashes, I got my first devil name: <code>shoruzorhorheugogeuzudeazaeon</code>. Go on, try to pronounce it. Isn’t it absolutely hilarious?</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<p>Even better: another, shorter, sweeter name appeared just six minutes later; <code>heapaepaemnunea</code>.</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<p>After this, I got two more: <code>somureamorumnaemeurheuzeuon</code> and <code>vqsjsawoqgygbrziydpkyyinfmfvw</code>.</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As I speak, I have computed another 12 billion hashes, or a grand total of about 35 billion, and no more names have appeared. I’m now going to shut it down, close my wallet, and use <code>heapaepaemnunea</code> as my #merveilles <em>nom de plume</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dqYz7Za.png" alt="16 billion hashes and just four devil names" /></p>
<p>It’s been fun! …and I can now assume <em>the face of the <strong>Devil</strong></em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 March 2017</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frustrated by the lack of easy-to-use web frameworks that support Rust
<strong>stable</strong>, I decided to use a stack that I know and love, and that has an
absolutely humongous amount of middleware that would do everything I wanted:
Node.js. But I wasn’t about to throw all the Rust code I’d written away!
Fortunately, that’s where <a href="https://www.neon-bindings.com/">Neon</a> comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Neon</strong> is a library and build tool that makes it drop-dead easy to expose a
Rust API as a Node.js module. Once I had that binding working and tested, it
was a breeze to use it in an Express server. Nevertheless, I hit a few gotchas,
patterns that weren’t obvious at first:</p>
<h2 id="hooking-up-a-neon-class"><a class="header" href="#hooking-up-a-neon-class">Hooking up a Neon class</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.neon-bindings.com/">Neon documentation</a> is a bit lacking right now. It’s still Rust
documentation, which is hands down the best auto-generated documentation I’ve
used, and I use it <em>a lot</em>. In fact, it being so good is the <em>reason</em> why I use
it a lot. Even without taking the time to write great documentation, the
auto-generated, no-effort, there-by-default parts are a boon to explore and
figure out a Rust API.</p>
<p>Still, for this I had to look at <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/tree/master/tests/">the neon tests</a> for example code.
Then I derived a pattern that I use for all such classes:</p>
<p>If I have a Neon class <code>JsFoo</code> declared in <code>jsfoo.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">declare_types! {
    pub class JsFoo for Foo {
        init(call) {
            // use one argument...
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I’d put this at the bottom of the file (making sure to have the right number of
arguments — that caught me out once or twice):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn new(call: Call) -&gt; JsResult&lt;JsFoo&gt; {
    let mut scope = call.scope;
    let args = call.arguments;

    // pass through one argument
    let arg0 = args.require(scope, 0)?;

    let foo_class = JsFoo::class(scope)?;
    let foo_ctor = foo_class.constructor(scope)?;
    foo_ctor.construct(scope, vec![arg0])
}</code></pre>
<p>And then in <code>lib.rs</code>, to hook it up to the module, it’s just a simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod foo;

register_module!(m, {
    m.export("foo", foo::new)?;
    // the other exports...

    Ok(())
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="constructing-neon-classes-with-rust-data"><a class="header" href="#constructing-neon-classes-with-rust-data">Constructing Neon classes with Rust data</a></h2>
<p>There’s a fairly common situation I ran into: I had a method on a Neon class or
a function on the module where I wanted to return another Neon class instance,
<em>filled with data generated in the Rust code.</em></p>
<p>In pure Rust, there’s typically several ways to construct a struct. But in JS,
there’s just the one constructor, and in Neon it’s even worse: there’s just the
one constructor, that only can take JS types as inputs.</p>
<p>The first thing I thought of was to modify the underlying Rust type directly.
So down I went reading through Neon source code, trying to figure out how I
could either <em>replace</em> the Rust value of a constructed Neon class… or implement
an entirely new constuctor, by hand, that would build the class but with Rust
data instead of JS data.</p>
<p>Turns out, this first one was the right idea… but the wrong, over-complicated
approach. This pattern has two sides:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have to make sure that my Neon class constructor is cheap, has no
side-effect, and does not depend on anything else than what I pass in.</p>
<p>I had at some point a constructor that would do disk I/O based on paths
passed in an arguments. That’s a no-go. I replaced it with a constructor
that only built up the underlying Rust type without doing anything else, and
a <code>load()</code> function that would do the I/O and spit out a modified class
instance using this very pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to <strong>wrap the target type in a tuple struct</strong>. That tuple struct
needs to have its field marked <code>pub</code>, and that’s what I target the Neon
class at.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct WrapFoo(pub Foo);

declare_types! {
    pub class JsFoo for WrapFoo {
        init(call) { ... }
    }
}</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With those two things done, the remaining bit is simple, especially combined
with the previous pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn load(call: Call) -&gt; JsResult&lt;JsList&gt; {
    let scope = call.scope;
    let args = call.arguments;
    let base = args.require(scope, 0)?.check::&lt;JsString&gt;()?.value();

    let posts = all::load(PathBuf::from(base)).to_vec();

    let farg = vec![JsArray::new(scope, 0)];

    // Look at the `jslist::new`! That's the pattern shown just before,
    // here used to construct a Neon class within a Rust function.
    let mut list = JsFunction::new(scope, jslist::new)?
        .call(scope, JsNull::new(), farg)?
        .check::&lt;JsList&gt;()?;

    // Here's the important bit!
    // See how the tuple struct wrapping allows you to replace the
    // underlying Rust value? That's the entire trick!
    list.grab(|list| list.0 = List::new(posts));
    Ok(list)
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="hiding-the-wrapping-type"><a class="header" href="#hiding-the-wrapping-type">Hiding the wrapping type</a></h3>
<p>When I was writing tests for my binding, I found that <code>typeof new List()</code> would
return <code>'WrapList'</code>… not what I want! I’d rather expose the “nice” name of the
struct. So, instead of the above, I bound the actual Rust struct to a different
name, and named the wrapping struct as the original name, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use list::List as RustList;

struct List(pub RustList);

declare_types! {
    pub class JsList for List {
        init(call) { ... }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>and now this works: <code>typeof new List() === 'List'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-jsarray"><a class="header" href="#making-a-jsarray">Making a JsArray</a></h2>
<p>This is much more straightforward, but I kept hitting it and then having to
either figure it out from the compiler messages and documentation all over
again, or referring to previous code.</p>
<p>Occasionally I want to create a JsArray. But there’s no easy
<code>JsArray::from_vec()</code>. I have to create a <code>JsArray</code> with a size, then fill it
up with values, taking care to set the right indices. And there’s also a lot of
boilerplate to make sure to use the correct variant of the <code>.set()</code> method, the
one with <strong>two</strong> parameters instead of <strong>three</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Object contains the `.set()` method on JsArray.
use neon::js::{JsArray, Object};

// Required to use `.deref_mut()`.
use std::ops::DerefMut;

// This is assuming we're starting with a Vec&lt;Handle&gt; named `vec`.
// If that's not the case, adjust the JsArray length and the .set()`.

let mut array: Handle&lt;JsArray&gt; = JsArray::new(scope, vec.len() as u32);

// The extra scoping block is necessary to avoid mut/immut clashing.
{
    // Here's where we borrow mutably, this is necessary to get access
    // to the underlying JsArray from the Handle, as the JsArray has
    // the 2-parameter `.set(key: Key, value: Value)` method.
    let raw_array = array.deref_mut();

    // We have to do our own indexing.
    let mut i: u32 = 0;

    for val in vec {
        // Setting an array value might fail! So we have to handle that.
        raw_array.set(i, val)?;
        i += 1;
    }
}

// Here's where we borrow immutably, as well as return the right type.
Ok(array.as_value(scope))</code></pre>
<p>That’s that for now!</p>

<p>Two days ago today, I had a dream.</p>
<p>It was mundane, simple, just a casual dream except for this one quality. I was driving along, going just a bit above the tolerance. Reckless, I know. I remember thinking that in the dream. I remember seeing a cop car in the back mirror, feeling scared. I remember seeing red in my forward vision while still watching the cop car in the mirror, switching focus, it’s a red light, slowing down, left lane, cop car in the right lane, next to me, not even done slowing done when it turns back to green and we go our separate ways. Cops turn right, I move on straight ahead. I remember feeling relief.</p>
<p>I don’t remember where I was going, what the road was, where I had come from, what time it was. It was day, sure, and there were probably clouds in the sky, because I don’t remember any shadows, either. Also, at the next intersection, I looked out the window, saw a blur, and woke up. It was a dream. It was a vivid dream.</p>
<p>Today as I was thinking of this prose I was driving. I was coming up to an intersection, going right, and there was a cop car in front of me, going left. And I remembered that scene, and I remembered being a bit scared, and I thought it was funny that everything was reversed. And I didn’t realise it had been a dream, that that scene I’d remembered, those feelings that had been conjured… they were from a dream. It didn’t happen. This realisation was what made me think of and write this.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time this has happened. In fact, it’s a pretty frequent occurrence in my life. See, I’ve always dreamed differently. Up until a few years ago, in 2009 to be precise, I didn’t know it. I thought everyone had dreams like I had. Lucid dreams where I knew I was dreaming. Controllable dreams where I could control any or even all aspect of the dream. Vivid dreams which could be so realist as to be indistinguishable from reality. Or any combination of the above.</p>
<p>That dream I told, above, is pretty innocuous. It’s a common scene. Nothing wrong with remembering it, even if I don’t realise immediately, or at all, that it didn’t happen. That I caught it at all is pretty rare, actually. Dreamed memories that banal usually just come and go undetected, until I remember having remembered them sometime later when I’m feeling introspective and realise <em>then</em>.</p>
<p>But there’s more scary. More bothersome.</p>
<p>Before 2009, I didn’t know about the term ‘lucid dream’. I didn’t know only a small percentage of the population had them, and an even smaller portion had them regularly or often enough that they could play with them. To me, it was normal. I’ve been dreaming ‘normally’, or lucid, or vivid, or in control, or any two, or all three, I’ve been dreaming like that since <em>forever</em>. My earliest memory of a dream was at the age of four, and I estimate it to have scored about 4 on the lucid scale, and 8 on the vivid one. No idea about the control.</p>
<p>Since 2009, I have experimented with my dreaming, and introspected about its influence on my life. I didn’t immediately realise the problem with my vivid dreams. In 2011, first year of university, one of the reasons I failed it, a reason I never voiced before, is that I spent the entire year dreaming. I was away from home, away from obligations, and classes seemed easy enough at the start, so I started sleeping in. I fucked my sleep cycle so bad during that year that it never recovered. I stayed awake for huge lengths of time, trying to find out the limits. There’s a saying that you die if you stay awake for more than 100 hours. On at least two occasions, I stayed awake for between 120 and 170 hours, I kinda lost track at those points. I’m still alive.</p>
<p>About every four weeks, I had lucid dreams. Sometimes just one, but often every night for a week. And then I dreamed non-lucid for three, or stayed awake, or something. I had really weird abstract dreams, I had dreams that spanned minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, decades. The longest in-dream time I ever experienced, without it being just a time-skip, was four hundred years. The shortest time was five seconds, going in slow-mo towards a car crash, but also really fast, and dreaming the perception of everybody on and around the scene. It’s one of the things my brain does sometimes: on good days, when I’m really tired, just before going to sleep, I can occasionally play every single instrument in a symphonic orchestra at the same time. It’s beautiful, and I control it, or at least I have that illusion of control, I’ve never been able to determine which was which.</p>
<p>When I was, I think, from what I pieced together from memories and discussions and fragments, about 7, in the summer holidays, probably july or august, I had a particular experience. I was on holiday on an island, nothing fancy, just a small island in the south or west from france, with a few apartment rises and a quay with those big metal things boats put their ropes on. I befriended a girl and we’d run around on the quays and at one point we fished from the quay, without a rod or anything, just a fishing line and some bait. Worms. I remember looking at the girl putting a worm on a hook and throwing it in, feeling a bit disgusted and fascinated at the same time. I remember having dinner with the girl and her parents. I remember trivial things like the storey of their apartment and washing my hands before eating. I don’t remember the girl’s name. Something starting with an M, and an A, and an O, maybe Margo but that’s just a name from my brain right now, it’s not from the memory of that experience. I remember staying on the island and playing with that girl for a week or so.</p>
<p>When I was 7, I was quite shy and my head was often in the clouds. To those who knew me then, that is probably a <em>significant</em> understatement. I thought my parents knew I’d gone on holiday, I mean, it was logical, I was 7, they <em>had</em> to have been there with me or sent me there with someone or something. Maybe we’d sailed there? Maybe the girl’s parents were friends with my parents? But it didn’t matter to my 7 year old mind. I just assumed they knew, and because I assumed they’d been there, or that we’d at least driven back home together, I didn’t even think of asking or saying anything about it. The next week I was probably back to going at a friend’s house for a sleepover and playing and spouting enough obviously-straight-out-of-my-imagination babble that anything about fishing with a girl on an island was lost in the mingle.</p>
<p>I asked several years later. Almost a decade. It was one of these, “Do you remember…” but mom didn’t remember. I gave more and more details but no. Mom didn’t remember anything like that happening. She told me of places I did go, when I was 6 or 7 or 8, places I went to, places we went to, people they were friends with that had children I met… none of it matched. So I was very confused, but I chalked it up to random weirdness and didn’t think more of it for another few years. It was before 2009, before I learned about the term ‘lucid dream’.</p>
<p>In 2012 that memory of those holidays, and the confused exchange later on, resurfaced and I understood. I understood that I sometimes had vivid dreams that were <em>so</em> vivid they were, to my brain, real. When I remembered them later on, if I didn’t also remember the memories came from a dream, I would assume they were real. In the fourteen years since I had that experience, I had remembered it countless times, without realising it was a <em>dream</em>. That the girl, the holiday, the place, the quay, the fishing, the emotions I felt, all of these things affected me… they had an impact on part of my life… <em>and they never existed</em>.</p>
<p>Ever since that first realisation, I have been on alert, looking hard at memories that pop up and trying to make sure that I know where they come from. Dream or reality. Real or not. Happened or didn’t. I have also been looking through my pre-2012 memories and doing the same thing. I catch a few. Whenever I know for sure that one memory is from a dream, I tag it so. I bring up the memory and make sure the world <strong>FAKE</strong> is watermarked everywhere on it. Because then when it pops up in my consciousness stream, so does the tag, and I know not to trust it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean I disown memories, try to forget them. Dreams are nice. But the damage of thinking that something happened when it didn’t, ever, is too potentially great. I’ve been lucky so far, and I’m on the lookout now, but countless fake memories slip through the cracks. One last vivid dream for this prose: I once dreamed of doing various everyday things, including reading a series of tweets by saf. And because I didn’t catch that, because it was such a small part in the whole, I didn’t remark anything unusual going on when I remembered them later on and integrated the information they provided to my model, my profile, my persona of saf. Several months later, she said something that contradicted that piece of information in a fundamental way. And I was shocked, and I introspected, and I found that dream and realised what happened. But imagine if it wasn’t reading tweets.</p>
<p>Imagine dreaming that you got some clue that indicated your significant other was cheating on you. And you went ahead and didn’t realise it and integrated it and one day you’re snappish and irritated at something or other and you feel vindictive and you say things you can’t take back and you accuse and your love life comes apart in five minutes because of something that never actually happened. Imagine finding out <em>afterwards</em>. (That scenario can’t actually happen to me because of other reasons I’m not going to explain right now, but that was just a simple-to-understand example of the magnitude of how things can go wrong because of this.)</p>
<p>So I try to be careful. And most of the time it seems to be fine. Some things go through the cracks, I’ve never and probably will never be able to find out just what, just how much, but I live on.</p>
<p>My name is Félix Saparelli, and I’m a vivid dreamer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 April 2017</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fanfiction is a study in what works and what doesn’t, and how something that
really seems like it shouldn’t work actually does if you do it in a particular
way. You get a lot of that in Ship Fanfiction, where most of the canon plot is
background, and the focus of the fic is the particular Ship it’s exploring.
There’s a LOT of Dramione out there that is really terrible. Clearly that ship
is a bad idea. But if you just switch a thing or two around, dim some canon
details, brighten others, change the levels of the picture it’s painting… and
then <em>write well</em>, you can actually make it appealing and have it not only
<em>work</em>, but also be quite genuine in its execution.</p>
<p>(A side note: Harry Potter fanficdom is by far the largest, so despite that
universe not being as good as others, and in fact being quite flawed, it’s
where there’s a lot of different examples of the patterns and interests of
fanfic.)</p>
<p>Another thing goes back to fanfic being social: fanfic is often <em>meta</em>. Not
just in the “this fanfic refers or hints or has homages to other fanfics” way.
But because of the way previous fanfic has already explored many different
concepts, a fanfic writer will have a general sense of fanfic tropes. There’s
stuff to avoid, there’s stuff that’s already been done a thousand times so it
can be <em>safe</em> to use if you need to have a filler, there’s stuff that’s
generally said to be impossible to do, so you attempt it anyway because you
want to see if you can do it. There’s community writing challenges, where you
get a concept and play with it, or try to write it in.</p>
<p>Fanfic authors, most of the time, are <em>aware of the context</em>. They’re aware of
the tropes. They’re aware of the trends. They’re aware of Murphy’s Law. And
they can <em>play with that</em>. Fiction (not fanfic) writers tend to not do that.
Except for a particular genre of comedy, which is somehow exempt of that
limitation.</p>
<p>To use one of the classic examples: If, in a fanfic, someone states “I won’t
die.” there is a more-than-even chance that the speaker will, or will come
close to it, just because the words were said. But <em>the writer knows that</em>. And
you, as a reader, <em>know that the writer knows that</em>. So now, the expectation is
that the words being there causing the action is <em>too obvious</em>. So it won’t
happen. Or there’ll be a twist in some way. Or maybe it happens, but only
off-screen. Fanfic writers, more often than other writers, <em>subvert</em> tropes,
instead of only writing them.</p>
<p>(And that’s an argument for non-fanfiction writers reading more fanfiction: so
they then are inspired to break tropes and make chaos, to not always write the
same whitewashed hero and conventional romances, to not always have Bad Romance
and Good Romance, but something in between, or something that transcends it, or
something that perverts it. And there’s writers doing that, sure, but they’re
too few and far between, I think.)</p>
<p>I see it a bit like the classical composers, who (according to Dad) would
compose something and then send it to their contemporaries and be like “look at
I did, can you improve on that?” and the recipients would create Variations on
a Theme, and tease out patterns that are interesting in their own right, and
then compose something around <em>that</em> and send it back. Or maybe take a minor
voice and make it major, take that movement that tells the story of the calm
and long lamentations of the Winter Lady and make it instead about the fast
wailing of a scorned lover, carve out the pattern the cellos are playing and
bring it to the fore into a concerto, completely eliminate the melody and see
what stands out… Essentially doing nothing but recursive fanmusic, and then
what little would get out to the public would sound <em>“so original, what a
delight”</em>… “here, have a bunch of money to keep doing what you’re doing”.</p>
<p>Another thing: while there <em>is</em> fanfic that keeps to the tone of canon, <em>that</em>
is actually a particular style, a challenge in fact. How to write something
that is <em>yours</em> while also following down to the beat and down to the semitone
the cadence and key of the original? The rest of fanfiction doesn’t follow
canon, and just… plays in the sandbox left by the original creator. It puts
concrete in the sand and erects impossible spires, it attempts to break out of
the walls, and it even invites itself in other sandboxes, bringing some of its
sand and some of its tools over to a completely new universe. But it’s all a
lot easier to get started and get writing and get exploring than building an
entirely new sandbox by yourself. It’s a lot less emotionally taxing, and that
translates as freedom to do a lot more.</p>
<p>Not that it means fanfic is always easy to write, I say as I add notes to my
detailed timeline of my Star Wars AU, which helpfully indicates, in an
intricate weaving of lines and colours, which parts are taken from canon, which
are mine, which refer to what other fanfiction, which are from Legends, which
are well-defined, which are up in the air. You can plan as <em>little</em> or as
<em>much</em> as you want, there’s no worldbuilding nor character development
necessary — only if you <em>want</em> to do it. And I like that about the medium.</p>

<p>When I try to determine how I feel about my gender in words, I go to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer">Genderqueer</a> wikipedia page. The article itself has a list of five ways
someone who is genderqueer may identify; it also has a nice aside listing every
genderkind known to wikipedia, and it references this list of <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/02/13/facebook_custom_gender_options_here_are_all_56_custom_options.html">Facebook
genders</a>. Generally speaking, I do not identify with <em>any</em> of these, including
the genderqueer, genderfluid, nonconforming, questioning, variant, neither,
male, female, or pangender kinds. The only label that possibly applies is
“other” but that’s not helpful at all.</p>
<p>I have no gender-related dysphoria. I am physically male and totally
comfortable that way. Mostly, <strong>I do not care about gender.</strong> <em>My</em> gender, I
mean. When I prod the ‘gender’ field in my brain’s information table, I get a
<code>E_NULL_POINTER</code> error. If you want to use gendered or non-gendered pronouns of
any kind or shape to refer to me, please go right ahead. Similarly with
gendered grammars. The only pronoun I may take offense at, in English (and
other languages if equivalent but I don’t know them) is “it”, unless it’s part
of a metaphor or something. There’s just one rule, and it’s not even
gender-related: make it consistent.</p>
<p>Otherwise it may be confusing.</p>

<p>I think I’ve finally figured out a name for my gender identity thing that feels
okay. Not super great. But… okay.</p>
<p>I’m not enby. Like, I’m <em>technically</em> non-binary, agender something, but also
like no. I’m not taking this label for myself. I feel like I would be taking

<p>When I wrote <a href="deprecated/unheld/guy-adjacent.html">Guy-Adjacent</a>, I positioned myself
from a position of not wanting to impede on a space I didn’t particularly think
I should occupy. Most of the sentiments expressed there remain the same: I am
neither oppressed nor disphoric, my mental health is… pretty good. However,
my approach to <em>words</em> has evolved.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I also think that placing myself, an NT, healthy, non-disphoric
person in these spaces I belong to may indeed <em>help</em> in “normalising” them.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m very much not a label absolutist. Indeed, I now take great pain in not
using the term label here, or around this topic in general. I prefer saying
“<strong>words</strong>”. <em>Words</em> is meant here as <em>words that are you</em>. It’s not about
labelling, it’s not about the outside world, it’s not about absolutes, not
about purity.</p>
<p><em>Words</em> have two sides, and one constant:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Words are about how <em>you</em> feel about them. You understand them in a certain
way. Their etymology, their use in your personal history, the way they
sound, their spelling, all these things are aspects of how they make you
feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words are about how <em>others</em> understand them. They understand them in some
certain ways. These might differ from the first. They might associate things
to them. They might have a connotation. “Others” is a very wide group, and
you should be careful both to exclude from your consideration those whose
feelings you don’t care for (because of hate, because of irrelevance,
because of distance), and to include those whose feelings you don’t
necessarily consider outright but may have a claim against the word (because
of kinship, because of culture, because of history).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words <em>change</em>. Their spelling, their grammar, their meaning. Slow or fast.
Sometimes both at once. Many times at different rates in different contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All those things are equal influences, all as important as each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>“<strong>Guy-adjacent</strong>” is still somewhat okay as a word. It’s one way to describe me.</p>
<p>Here are others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<strong>French</strong>”. I was born there, I speak the language, I do identify with my
people. In some ways, and not in others, but I do. I have an accent when I
speak English. I have culture and mannerisms and ways of thought which are
very French. It is absolutely a word of mine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>New Zealander</strong>”. I am a citizen of this country. I love it. I chose it,
in multiple ways. I don’t really claim “Kiwi”, but I acknowledge it. I have
an accent when I speak English. And French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Solitaire</strong>”. I like being alone. I’m okay with “introvert” from some
people, especially other introverts, but I neither claim the word nor
recognise it always. I recharge by staying away from people, and I shy away
from too much socialities, but I do enjoy company, and I do go and brave
crowds every so often. I get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_symptom_attack">limited panics</a> when I’m under too much
exposure to others for too long: this is fairly frequent after conferences,
or even during for long ones. I will happily not talk to anyone else for an
entire week, if I’m given the opportunity (solo hiking trips being pretty
much the only time nowadays — social media counts as talking!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Pansexual</strong>”. With some preferences towards some aspects. Also “bisexual”
which was my previous preference over “pan” — words and thoughts change! I
reject “sapiosexual” (connotations are strongly against, and I very much
don’t get horny only for <em>brains</em> whether physical or metaphoric). I’d say
that the <em>potential</em> is there within the general population, and I do get
attracted to some and not others, but the divide is neither on gender nor body
traits. If I figure it out decisively one day I’ll pick a better word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Demi-romantic</strong>”. Not “demi-sexual”. Not “aromantic”. I get crushes. I do
fall in love. It doesn’t happen always, but most importantly for this word:
I don’t feel like it’s something missing. “Bachelor” is a word I’ll
acquiesce to, but won’t use for myself unless it’s right for the context. (I
only fall within <em>some</em> of its senses, anyway. My uncle was a bachelor until
he found his wife; I will remain demi-romantic even if I do find
companionship.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Non-binary</strong>”. I am that. See the first section of this post, and the
previous article, for how I am <em>not</em> like some others who use that word.
But I definitely am. Like the other below, I knew I was non-binary before
I knew it was a thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Poly(am)</strong>”. Not out of the absolute <em>need</em> to be with more than one person
(see demi above), although that varies with context, but out of the complete
lack of any feeling regarding being “mono”. I do not care for it, in all
meanings of the phrase. That too, I knew about myself before I knew it had a
word.</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>23 June 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the third in a series of posts going back to 2017 where I attempt to describe the labels
that apply to me. The first, “Guy-Adjacent”, I know some people liked a lot and resonated with some
of the things in it, but it doesn’t match me <em>at all</em> anymore. It’s there, though.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the preface of “My words,” I self-describe as neither being oppressed nor dysphoric, having
pretty good mental health, being NT, being healthy.</p>
<p>That is, to a certain extent, still true. It is also not completely accurate, and I have come to
realise, <em>wasn’t</em> even when I wrote the previous post. Self-discovery is a thing. Cease of denial is
also a thing.</p>
<p>I am not NT (neurotypical). I, however, feel quite inappropriate in claiming the ND (neurodivergent)
label. I don’t feel like I belong in either category, which could be anniying if I cared a lot about
categories or labels, but I don’t really. I’m not presently interested in getting diagnosed in any
particular direction, either. But I do recognise I am not NT, and that’s a step. I think.</p>
<p>I am not the picture of health. I have an invisible, undiagnosed chronic illness or condition, which
after much questioning, sounds pretty similar to, if an incredibly mild version of, a named
condition. But maybe I think that because several friends <em>do</em> have that named condition, properly
diagnosed, and I recognise myself in my friends. I would never want to make their struggles and
hardship about me, though, so I’m not going to associate myself with it. I’m also very wary of
something that sounds very much like a general “we have no idea, let’s describe the symptoms and
call it a thing” which I’m sure is helpful from a medical and also community point of view, but is
super despairing from the perspective of someone wondering about what they have and if it’s ever
fixable and with a dislike of doctors. I probably need therapy. And medical care. I don’t know if
I’ll ever work up the nerve to push past my past experiences and get there, which sounds very silly
because I KNOW I HAVE THE PROBLEM, WHY WON’T I DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.</p>
<p>Speaking of mental health, I don’t have impostor syndrome anymore. Wooo. It only took several years.
I still have a latent fear of rejection. But I’m pretty confident in my skills now, and most
importantly, I’m pretty confident in the skills I <em>don’t</em> have. I think that helps tremendously,
from a privileged position, to admit to myself this vulnerability or ‘weakness’.</p>
<hr />
<p>But enough about health. One other very important change from the previous post is to stop trying to
avoid the word “label.” I will never like it much, but in the last post I made a rather obvious
mistake, in that I described that “words” are about communication, and failed to realise that the
word “label” is also about communication. “Words” is very unspecific. “Labels” might feel icky and
have interpretations I’d rather avoid, but it certainly has specific <em>shared</em> meaning, and that
helps tremendously in communicating what I mean.</p>
<p>So the specific things I said in the previous post are still true: labels are for me, labels are for
you, labels change, labels are not absolute. Labels are useful to communicate along a shared
understanding, but it’s still extremely important to me that labels are only about this
communication and sharing, and are not utterly accurate, finite, bounded, prescriptive descriptions
of me and who I am.</p>
<p>Let’s get the easy stuff out of the way: I am <strong>French</strong>, I am <strong>Pākehā</strong>, a <strong>New Zealander</strong>,
sometimes a <strong>kiwi</strong> depending on context. I am technically European, but don’t really have it as an
identity, and certainly do not feel like an NZ European, whatever that means. I am European in an
Europe context, but not in an Aotearoa context.</p>
<p>I am kind of an introvert, but still neither like the word nor the implied dichotomy. I’ll claim
<strong>solitaire</strong>, not the card game (I like French tarot, if you must know), but I prefer avoiding
crowds and large social occasions. I’ve tried, I’ve been pushed this way, that way… doesn’t work.</p>
<p>I am <strong>gendermeh with boy flavour</strong>. I actively dislike “guy” as a gendered marker and as a group
noun, but as a general address I’m not bothered. I don’t give a fuck about masculinity, or feminity
for that matter. I’m very happy being me, and everything else can go. I am technically
<strong>non-binary</strong>, and will claim that label, but getting increasingly disillusioned with the discourse
around it; specifically, I feel that making it a sort of “third gender” is very reductive and misses
the entire point. I neither have a strong gender identity, nor care to describe it. To make a
programming joke: I am both weakly gendered and statically gendered, but I don’t fit in the type
system.</p>
<p>I am <strong>cis</strong> in that I am not trans. That’s pretty simple. I don’t strongly identify <em>as</em> cis,
but I am also <em>not</em> trans, and the least I can do for that community is claim this, in support.</p>
<p>Sexuality-wise, I’ll still claim both bisexuality and pansexuality, leaning towards one or
the other depending on context. But I’m not sexual or romantic enough to really identify with any
particular label. I’m not ace, and I’m not aro, but I’m not very ro either. I am neither poly nor
mono amorous, but I’ll go with poly for lack of anything better.</p>
<p>This is roughly in the order I care about. And that’s pretty much it.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Question</strong>: I think [AI tools] can be helpful and save developer time when
used correctly, but you cannot trust them to generate correct code. That’s why
strong type systems (like Rust’s) are still very important for checking program
correctness (combined with unit tests etc.).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>My comment:</strong></p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I have free Github Copilot via the OSS maintainer program)</p>
<p>I agree that compared to a JavaScript codebase, Rust does help catch the most
egregious AI mistakes. However, what I’ve found is that AI codegen is often
either subtly wrong in the nitty gritty logic (makes sense, it can’t reason),
or correct in mechanistic execution but wrong in approach (say I wanted an
implementation that did the least amount of expensive copies, and the AI
codegen’d something that Arc’d everything).</p>
<p>I find that the older dumber AI models were in fact more productive, in that
they were more like pattern-replicating tools (give it an example impl and a
list of types and it will generate an impl per type with the correct
substitutions, even if there’s differing cases and plurals/singulars transforms
to do, which editor macros have difficulty with, or would take comparitively
too long).</p>
<p>As a result I’ve gone from “ignore suggestions 95% of the time” to “disable
copilot globally and enable it for singular tasks.” I find that I have a
renewed productivity and heightened enjoyment of solving problems; that indeed
Copilot, even if I ignored its solutions, would influence my direction. While
initially it feels like a productivity upgrade, in the end it’s like slogging
against the machine, trying to make it do what I want.</p>
<p>I very much feel like I’m in a science fiction novel of the last millenium in
saying that, but using AI codegen or chat is handing off your thought process
to a computer and being in this forever fog of frustration and feeling <em>wrong</em>
but surely you can’t unplug, for unplugging would be coming back to the last
great age where we still banged rocks together.</p>
<p>I find that I improve my craft less or not at all when using AI codegen,
because I’m not <em>using my brain to solve problems from scratch.</em></p>
<p>I am moderately worried — moderately because I don’t have good data on it —
that this whole experiment is going to spell disaster for knowledge industries.
I am by no means a beginner. In fact I find that I am in some ways so far
removed from the experience of learning Rust basics that I completely fail at
<em>teaching</em> it, which not a humble brag but rather a distressing realisation. If
<em>I</em> feel like using AI is preventing <em>me</em> to effectively keep improving
<em>myself</em>, then what happens to someone who spent their entire programming life
with AI?</p>
<p>Yet I see a lot of beginners who say they’re helped by AI, especially AI chat,
because they’re able to ask questions and have instant answers. Those might be
wrong to an extent, but so might a human mentor. I don’t really know what to
feel here. I am no longer at a stage where talking to a chatbot genuinely helps
me solve problems, because the problems I have cannot be answered by a language
model. They require reason and empathy. And yes, I <em>am</em> talking of software
development problems. So I can’t relate to this need, but that doesn’t mean it
doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>I find it profoundly sad that Stack Overflow and related sites now have a
reputation, deserved or not, for being hostile and unapproachable. I do believe
that, compared to inscrutable Discords, interminable GitHub Issues threads,
disorganised wikis, or unfocused forum and reddit and social posts, the Stack
Overflow Q&amp;A model was (in 2010-2015 at least) the best at providing short and
long term resources in a fairly lightweight community-building format. The
rules made it hard for newbies, but they cannot be removed, for it is the rules
that force you to <em>learn how to ask a question.</em> To learn to think through your
problem. There were many times when I found my solution while writing a
question; a kind of rubber duck but into a textbox.</p>
<p>The problem I have with chat AI is that it doesn’t know how to say <em>“I don’t
know.”</em> It is the ultimate rubber duck programming tool, but where a rubber
duck can’t answer if you yourself cannot solve your own problem, and where a
well-run Q&amp;A site will eventually find the right answer (and the right person
to answer the question), chat AI will confidently invent utter bullshit. And it
will do so in a way that is indistinguishable from when it gives the correct
answer. <em>And</em> it might, at random, answer simple questions wrong because it got
tripped up by an irrelevant word.</p>
<p>Another thing I find is that colleagues at work spend time asking Claude the
same question again and again. They’ll do prompt engineering for fifteen
minutes if they’re not satisfied, instead of going “ah well, let me just think
for three minutes instead of getting an instant answer.” They’ll eschew more
precise tools, including their own mind, for the all-doing box of averages.</p>
<p>So yes, I think that Rust gives you a marginal advantage against say, JS or PHP
or C when using it with AI. But while I do use Copilot for specific
pattern-replicating tasks, where it excels, I think it is a net negative to use
for general purpose programming, regardless of language.</p>
<p>Of course, your experience may vary.</p>
