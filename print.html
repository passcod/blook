<h2 id="fanfic"><a class="header" href="#fanfic">Fanfic</a></h2>
<p>Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don’t include fics I read but didn’t like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn’t include all
I read that <em>wasn’t</em> fanfic.</p>

<p>There’s been two chapters of <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/tourist/">Tourist</a> this period, so naturally I’ve commented
with my impressions on both: <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2016/12/23/tourist-five/#comment-415">[1]</a>, <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2017/01/07/tourist-six/#comment-423">[2]</a>. <strong>Tourist</strong> is
<a href="https://twitter.com/Wanderlustin">Saf</a>‘s current serial novel about AI and asexuality and depression and it’s
great! Not only do I love her writing, I love the themes and the way she
explores them. There’s a few scenes which evoke a very particular feeling I’ve
experienced, and it’s fascinating that Saf is able to make me remember how that
feeling is like just through her words. The writing was perhaps a little
hesitant at first, but it’s been getting better and better every chapter. The
latest chapter is excellent.</p>

<p>Despite claiming, as is usual, that all belongs to Rowling, this fic really
only uses the characters and some general elements of plot. The universe is
one of the most original I have ever read. It is an utterly different world,
and extremely well built and detailed. Not content to be defined over a few
departure points, it is rich of several dozen centuries of history with a
particular focus, due to the story, around Europe, the British Isles, and the
Americas. But this world is dark and cruel and bleak, and that itself is a
terrible understatement. Content warnings for sexual and otherwise abuse,
exploitation, horror... and yet that feels like too little said. It is a very
good work. It surpasses many original, published, novels I have read in the
genre. But while it hooked me and wouldn’t let me go as I devoured it, each
further installment shook me deeper. Even with an active imagination and few
of the ‘moral’ blockers on thought most my peers have, this world and its
inhabitants shocked me in their depravity and casual evil, but most
importantly, in the way it showed every single cause and character as
believing they were in the right, even while performing and perpetuating
wickedness, resulting in institutionalised malevolence in every situation and
at every level of society. Even the heroes, the protagonists, the good ones,
those trying to quite literally save the world from itself, are merely
<em>questionably good</em> most of the time. It is a dark, dark work, but it is
very, very good. It’ll haunt me for a while. If you at all can, <strong>read it.</strong>

<p>Interesting format, with distinct arcs corresponding to Naruto’s missions
instead of a single continuity of plot. It makes the whole thing more
approachable, and sets clear expectations around the progression of a
particular writing stint. Unfinished, but not abandoned; there are long-term
plot lines still in suspens (and I’m not talking about the canon plot lurking
in the background, rather about the original plot lines that make it all
interesting). {370k words at time of writing}</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yet another marriage contract story. What can I say? I like
romance, and this is one of the most popular and least sappy romance genre in
this fandom. I found the basis for the story interesting, and the resolution
swift if perhaps a bit anti-climatic. But then again, the defeat of Voldemort
was never the focus of the plot. The fic brushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813949273528102912">some thoughts</a>
I had while reading, namely on the influence Harry’s near worship for a
decade, without having a real person to mellow it, would have had on society,
particularly regarding standards of appearance and, to a lesser extent,
behaviour. There was a strange consistent corruption to the spelling of some
words, almost as if the text had been OCR’d: notably, various ‘I’ or ‘i’
letters had been replaced with ‘1’, but not all of them. {165k words}</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern">Jbern</a> rarely disappoints. This was a fun story, but not a Humour story.
Typical plot of Individual!Harry going against Dumbledore, but various
atypical plot elements, mostly around making typically-always-good characters
have questionable morals and make less-than-Light decisions, and making
typically-always-evil characters be borderline good but forced in a bad
situation. It adds an interesting realism. Few bad points, but one in
particular (rot13): va gung lrf, gurer vf n cybg-rkphfr sbe ebznapr gb tb

<p>This was really really good. I love Hermione time travel stories. I love when
all the characters have their own flame, their own passions and thoughts and
reasons and defects. I also really love stories that were planned out before
they were written, and written before they were published, as they are
invariably of better quality, simply due to having been revised and
cross-written. Contains graphic sex, but gentle and hot and furious and
<em>real</em>. Some scenes reminded me of sex I’ve had, see, that’s how good and
real it was. Also contains instances of graphic violence, but not gore, and
not deeply disturbing. It covers war (both of them) and terror and torture,
but it’s not meant to shock and disgust. If you read nothing else on this
list, I do recommend this one. {555k words}</p>

<p>This list is getting way too long, but fortunately we’re two days before this
update goes out and the next few fics I have queued are crackfics or
small-length fics, so they should all make it into the short format list
below. Well-written, and with a delightful amount of lesbian, gay, and bi
characters, all presented positively, little prejudice in this regard all
around. Also remarkably good with letting everyone be happy with their
various religions, while calling out cultural misappropriation. No trans or
enbies that I could find, but we’re getting there. I’ve noticed several
possible references to HPMoR; generally I chalk those up to coincidence
because the fics are HPMoR-antecedent, but this one is mid-to-late 2016, so
it fits, and the references are multiple and fairly clear. Happy-ending fic,
even more so than the other happy-ending fics I’ve read recently; this is
positively Disney-esque in its epilogue. Although it’s certainly <em>not</em>
Disney-esque in its contents, with sex à gogo, lots of innuendo, etc. There’s
also violence and abuse present, this isn’t an all-rainbows fest. One
persistent bad point: the cavalier way horrific fates are dished onto some
antagonists. Sure, it might seem like karmic retribution, but cheerfully
finishing off Malfoy by having him be taken by <em>human traffickers intent on
forcing him into prostitution</em> still leaves a bad taste in. {520k words}</p>

<p>A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me <em>not</em> to write a Star Wars
× Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
potential the crossover’s universe has… many stories could have been written
within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers’
imagination. Rated T. {135k words}</p>

<p>Rated T but should have been M. Probably. This is Dune, but in the Star Wars
universe, with more sex and less Bene Gesserit. It does a good job of showing
the horror of the amount of lives lost during space conflict, when billions
of lives cry out in the Force, and it has an actual effect on those
sensitive. In the original six, there is a whole three minutes spent on the
destruction of a planet and millions of souls; two Jedi briefly look up and
say, almost deadpan, that they felt two billion souls die… and then they go
back to what they were doing, barely affected. In TFA, Starkiller Base
destroys five planets — there are no estimates I could find on the population
of the system, but let’s put it in the high dozen billions, maybe even half a
trillion — and there is even less effect on the Force-sensitive. Like, come
on! Billions have just died. At least show the Force-touched having a
<em>little</em> emotion here, maybe. So, in The Last Jedi, our protagonist Tobin, as
a youngling, witnesses the killing of “merely” thousands and feels it in the
Force, and it disturbs him so greatly that he has to isolate himself and cry
for hours at a time. A trained Jedi Knight is shown as losing control of her
emotions in violent manner. Even a less-monstrously-sensitive Mirakula is
strained and isolates herself, even while she has lived through dozens or
hundreds of such events already and could be thought to be inured against the
horror. Anyway, as you may see, I liked this fic a lot. {185k words}</p>

<p>Good story. The plots are thought-out and I really appreciate the insight
into other characters. The entire Chamber of Secrets episode, in particular,
is as much about Ginny and her struggle against Tom, than it is about Harry
and Sirius and friends… and then after that, the experience didn’t just
completely not matter, there are credible post-trauma effects, and the people
around don’t just forget what they’ve been through either. Last volume is
unfinished at time of writing, but updated recently. I’m hoping for a
Harry/Ginny ship but not holding my breath: there’s a lot of potential still.

You know that quote about how grown-up fiction is about english professors
wondering about who to fuck, and YA fiction is about overthrowing the
government and picking up the pieces? This is grown-up YA fiction. The
government has been overthrown, the villains have been defeated, and there’s
still the shit attitudes in society that caused it all in the first place —
but we’re working on that. There’s peace. But it’s the picking up of pieces
that remains to be done. Recovering from all you’ve lived, and figuring out
where you’re going. Treating all the fucked up stuff you’ve done and that’s
still in your head. Talking to people. Getting angry and pissed off and
breaking up and making up and it all not being the literal end of the world.

<p>Has complex plots without being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they’re used,
without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
time travel mechanisms I have ever read since HPMoR, and it probably
surpasses that, even: used hundreds of times, over a year thrice folded on
itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in HPMoR where we are
told Dumbledore+Snape+Potter-Evans-Verres make plans and schemas and diagrams
but there’s only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and
explained. And even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn’t
depend entirely on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance
planning, munchkinning, and other techniques all combine together in an
explosive mix, with no less than three different plots going on at the same
time… at any given time. And that’s just the first book! The second book is
ongoing, and I am loving it. {274k + 131k words atow}</p>

<p>This is brilliant. Also fun and humourous and just the right amount of
flirty. Long chapters, lots of action: physical, verbal, and otherwise.
There’s a very hot dominant sex scene right at the start of the second
chapter, preceded (at the end of the first) by a bunch of realistic in-public
affection and… more. It’s honestly refreshing, after decidedly adult fics
that nevertheless ellide any actual action, and a wide corpus of fics that
deal with more or less horny teenagers instead of mature (<em>cough</em> as if
<em>cough</em>) young adults. Ongoing. {60k words atow}</p>

<p>I love the perspective into and out of all the characters, especially Ahsoka
and Aayla. The analysis and conflicting opinions of power structures with the
Galaxy by an outsider that still has considerable experience that is more or
less relatable, and by insider people both accepted and excluded from those
same structures, yields interesting discussions packed with details. The “too
many assumptions” thing resonated particularly with me, as it is something I
struggle with when interacting with some people I know (they make assumptions
that are often wrong or incomplete and draw concludions from that, without
ever pausing to ask themselves or others about them, and end up making wild
accusations that are hard to defend upon on the spot (and they then take that
hesitation as admission of guilt, instead of confusion or trying to organise
thoughts) as I need to think about what their assumptions could be that they
end up there; the entire exercise is very frustrating). There are spectacular
scenes of magic and action, the forces involved are of epic proportions, and
yet humour both by characters and by story is pervasive. It’s a good mix.

<p>It starts like any other teenager romance… well, the troubled ones anyway.
Girl runs away from home, boy runs away from life, they meet and fall into
friendship first, and then into love. But the likeness stops here. Because
this is a Harry Potter story, and that means heartbreak, it means danger, it
means terror, it means conflict and drama and emotions running high in all
directions. It means magic, and all the problems that brings with it. It
means love. And so <em>Behind Blue Eyes</em> finishes like few other adult romances…
with pain and loss and success and that particular kind of happiness that is
like the flame of a phoenix: strong and bright, reborn many times, and
fiercely everlasting. {440k words}</p>

<p>And then I started earnestly into writing my fanfic, and predictably, I got to
reading lots more Star Wars fics. Official pretext for this is “gotta find
voices and get into the feel for writing my characters” but of course the plots
and cuties are why I stay.</p>
<p>But seriously, encountering characters I’m writing and have been thinking about
for the past few months in other fanfics is pretty cool. It really lets me
figure out the edges of my characters, and think about behaviour/personality
for more than just the obvious by comparing against what I’m reading. And when
something really clashes, I have to think and mentally point out details that
justify why I feel like the characterisation is wrong.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a few fics-with-Rey below that have her as a sociable
lovable figure who trusts people easily, like, what??? No. She’s been a
scavenger for fifteen years, she’s canonically been betrayed by people she
thought were her peers fairly early on, she lived alone for ages, she was
exploited by adults around her until she got strong enough to fuck off on her
own, one of the only beings who halfway protected her and gave her the
opportunity to earn for the past ten years called the Empire on her (<em>this is
portrayed somewhat differently in the novelisations, but while the details
change a bit, the broad strokes remain the same</em>) at the drop of a hat. She’s
not going to be a bubbly extrovert now. What is wrong with you.</p>

<p>I’m going on a strong Star Wars (all eras confounded) bender. I avoid Kylo/Rey
(extra ew) and Kylo/Hux fics because ew, and I like time travel fix-it fics.
Mostly I’ve been impressed at the depth and breadth of the verses crafted, and
the large currency held by Queer-abundant fics. It “makes sense” to have
genderqueer and varied sexualities in a universe where there’s several dozen
<em>species</em> cohabiting with each other, among a few <em>thousand</em> worlds (sometimes
the scale of it all boggles the mind), but it’s heartwarming every time.</p>
<p>I’ll certainly be adding a bunch of references and homages to some of the best
fics out there into <em>my</em> fic, mostly in passing-by references to names and
places. If you’ve been in the fanficdom, you should be able to pick out a few!</p>
<p>Something that’s been interesting to notice is fics and authors that were
influenced by the Re-Entry fanfic epic. You see, in Canon (and Legends)
Coruscant has a 24-hour day. In the Re-Entry fanon, though, Coruscant has a
26-hour day. Well, in many non-Re-Entry fics that should AU from Canon or
Legends, and that state it as such, you get mentions of “25th hour” or “there
isn’t more than 26 hours in the day” while in the Coruscanti Jedi Temple (or
elsewhere on planet)!</p>

<p>{SW} <strong><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/392674">More Than Our Makers Intended</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Excellent fic both in the romance/ship side and in the PTSD side. Notably,
<em>actually gets</em> that Rey comes from a desert-world where water is precious
and food was scarce and she is used to work and also not used to have food be
guaranteed. Similarly, that Finn was a trooper in an extremely harsh and
conditioned army, where even trivial-for-bacta medical issues were more often
than not resolved with blaster-aided disappearances. Also great at non-binary
and queer genders and sexualities in a wider universe without making it be a
super minor discreet story element (like some novels do, like they want to
have it but also are afraid to bring it front and center). {26k + 26k + 4k

<li>
<p>{SW} <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8987779">heart in a headlock</a>.</p>
<p>Well-written, really, and has good emotions… I would have liked Rogue One to
go more like this, I think. The depiction of Leia in this fic helped me
re-evaluate a plot point that always bothered me in my fic, and that I’m
going to change now. {53k words atow}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{SW} <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/10129274">Back From the Future: Episode IV The Clone Wars</a>.</p>
<p>Has a fairly unique narrative style and form that I’m going to liberally
borrow from, and not just because it seems tailor-made for my style and
cadence of writing. I had been despairing of the glueing work I’d have to do
to make my fic work, and the rewriting of scenes to comply with One
Narrative, but this is much better. Story-wise, this is well done, both in
plot that is organised and yet still surprising, in style which is “crack
that takes itself seriously” and manages that perfectly, in humour both
wordplay and plot irony and situational, in character development as well as
characters stubbornly refusing to change, for good and bad. {107k words}</p>

<li>
<p>{LotR} <strong><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/855528">Sansûkh</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another incredible epic fanfic. I really like both the concept and the
execution, and have healthy respect for the huge amounts of research and
outright creation that must have gone into it. The character growth shown and
told for everyone involved is first-rate. The use of Sindarin and Khuzdul is
appropriate and not overbearing, which is very well done indeed. And the
language style itself, that manner of speaking… I love that. (Also the
massive amounts of recursive fanart displayed throughout is both heartening
and frankly quite cute.) <em>AND DID I MENTION the vast diversity of cast!</em>
Gay/bi are merely common, colour is varying and fine, neuro-atypicals are
well-represented, and a/bi/trans-gender characters! That’s right, with a
plural! Not just two, either. Now <em>that</em>‘s greatness. {518k words atow}</p>

<p>One of the best fics I’ve read this month, perhaps even <em>the</em> best. It is
very much a rationalist fic, where not only the world is constructed in a
rational manner, but the characters are shown to think and behave according
to complex <em>reason</em> rather than just whatever the author needed to happen at
this point in time. (A work that does only the former is called a “rational”
fic, which is too subtle a word difference I think.) Does enough original
worldbuilding that it can get where it wants, without overwhelming the
story, even though one can just <em>see</em> the author could happily write an
entire volume about their own part and culture of the world rather than
stick to the Star Wars locations and stories. A+, would recommend. {15k +

<p>That was delightful. While the disappearance of Harry isn’t yet resolved, and
honestly at this point feels a bit too much like a convenient way to get the
main plot out of the way so we can explore Nizar’s in peace, <em>I really don’t
mind</em>. Nizar — and the story — is sweet and quietly humourous. Heartily

<p>Set in the Harry Potter verse, but ten years after Voldie’s death, and set in
America. Does not really mention Britain or Harry or any of them. Besides the
story itself, which is excellent, the context of wizarding prejudices and
house-elves within the wider context of America’s deep history and current
affairs with racism, corruption, police/authority violence and routine
violation of the very laws they are supposed to defend, paints a chilling
universe that left me uneasy throughout my read. On top of that, the quiet
horror of schooling practices that reflects, no doubt, their non-magical
counterparts in our reality only serves to reinforce the idea that there is
something fundamentally <em>wrong</em> with that country, and magic does not help.
A recommended read, albeit with warnings. {166k + 235k + 204k + 262k words}</p>

<p>The premise is the most interesting I’ve read in a while, even in the already
crowded genre of time travel, and even counting time travel closing-the-loop
fics of the same order of magnitude on the time scale. Which, by the way,
another very good fic which comes close to the premise and scale is one
recommended last month, the <em>Of a Linear Circle</em> series.</p>
<p>However, <em>A Long Journey Home</em> shines by its radically different
story-telling, a sequence of extended vignettes in the long life of one
Jasmine Potter, showing many stories and histories, each standing alone with
grace and yet much richer for its part in the whole. The theories and
explorations its characters go through, both personally and of magic, are
rendered beautifully and yet without glamouring or wonderwashing, and without
the praise-science-preach-science approach of ‘conventional’ rationalist
fiction.</p>
<p>And yes, this <em>is</em> rationalist fiction, but embedded in great writing as an
integral part of the work, instead of using the work as a mere transport.

<p>This is an excellent fic, if very graphic given its premise and content.
There is little that I dislike about it: most of that is the lack of
proofreading consistent throughout. It’s not badly written, but there’s words
missing, awkward wording, common typos, etc. The story is well-organised into
arcs and subarcs and side-stories, with very good blending and threading so
while you can see the different arcs, they don’t feel disjointed at all. The
principles that the Jedi are orienting themselves towards is also a great
boon to me, as it is exactly the kind of thing one group in my Dawnverse is
going for, so it’s giving me both confirmation and ideas on how to write it.
Heartily recommend, albeit with warnings for very graphic violence and abuse.

<p>I’m running out of nice things to say about fics. Assume the details: it’s a
great fic, well-written, good arcs, awesome concept, etc. What I found really
interesting about it is the point of view of people under an authoritarian
regime. There’s not much by people who enjoy serving under it, and not much
by people who resist, although there’s a bit of both. No, what’s there most
is people who believe they’re doing the right thing, for very good reasons,
who are <em>loyal</em> to the regime, when they really really shouldn’t be. There’s
people destroying themselves to survive, at any cost. It’s a story about
shades of people operating in a shady world where no circumstance, no
decision, is ever black and white, right or wrong, wholly good or wholly
evil. It’s a convincing and chilling perspective, especially here, today.

<p>There are many good fanfictions, and many good books, but there are few great
ones. This is one of them. Like many, it was written over a long time,
refined and cultivated. It marries story, originality, and emotion in one big
happy polyamorous family, and the climaxes are exhalting if terribly shaking.
And of course, nothing is a coincidence, and everything is fucking poetry. A
delight. {117k words}</p>
