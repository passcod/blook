Prior to today, Saturday 13th February 2016, all my works were, by default,
released in the Public Domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0.

This is no longer the case.

While many of my works still remain in the public domain, and a large
amount are under permissive licenses, new works are not automatically
released.

All versions of the Blanket License, are cancelled, nulled, voided, revoked.

My mind on licensing has changed since that day years ago when I created my
blanket license. As such, this.
