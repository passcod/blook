Yes, yes I am.

Adapted from [the mtwitter contributing guidelines][0], here are rules
I expect people to adhere to when contributing to (my) projects. Those
parens are there because a lot of this is good practice in general. Do
note, however, that these are quite opiniated and, well, strict. Some
will disagree. People do things differently. Even I have been known to
be lax in applying these guidelines.

There's a lot of material, so I have both a non-informative tl;dr, and
a much better __quick summary__ below.

__tl;dr: be nice, be patient, learn, and have fun!__

## Standard Etiquette

### Introduction

Most git projects nowadays use a variation on the same branching
and workflow model. Here's [a great writeup][se1] of quite a rigid
implementation of the model. Simpler projects often do away with
the fluff and focus on the essential.

### Main branch

There's often few (one) main branch: __master__. The rest are
features and fixes. The __gh-pages__ branch is generally separate,
and might not be a manual-editing branch (i.e. it could be
automatically generated), take care of fixing the real source, not
its results.

### Topical branches

The rest of the branches are for features and fixes. They should
have descriptive names. This is no only to be pretty, but also so
a maintainer can pull a contributor's branch and test it locally
without clobbering any work.

Use the present tense and try to keep it short. Some projects use
prefixes to differentiate features, fixes, etc. Have a look at
existing branches and pull requests to get an idea of what is done.
Branch names should be `[a-z0-9\-]`: lowercase alphanumeric ascii
with hyphens.

For example, a feature branch to implement stream pooling could be
named `implement-stream-pooling` or `stream-pooling` or `stream-pools`
or `feature-stream-pooling`. A bugfix branch to repair tests failing
due to timeouts being too low could be named `fix-tests-timeouts` or
`longer-tests-timeouts`.

### Version tags

Tags are used for versions, and follow the `vN.N.N` model. Tags should
correspond with the code (package.json, .gemspec, manifests, etc) and
the published package (npm, rubygems, app stores, etc) for that release.
They are often set by maintainers only. They follow [semver][se4].

### Commits

Always rebase your commit history to present a clean face. When asked
to fix typos or do small modifications, fold them in by amending the
previous commit and forcing a push (this is a reason why you use
branches!). Don't mention the file you have edited in the commit
message if it's only a single file: it's redundant information. For
example, don't use `Update README.md` but rather `Fix typo in code sample`.

Commit messages should be [well formed][se2] (if you're reading that
blog post, ignore the double spaces after periods; the current consensus
on this is to use single spaces). If you have used code from somebody
else, or inspired by somebody else, mention them in the commit. Include
links if necessary.

_Optional_: The last paragraph should be a newline-delimited list of
pertinent issues, if applicable.

For example:

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72-80
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

 - Use a hanging indent

```

### Pull requests

Standard internet etiquette (spelling, grammar, be courteous). Also:

 - Include a good description of the changes, except if the title
   is self-evident.

 - If you're touching on things discussed in other issues, mention
   them. If you're committing code that's not yours, mention that.
   If there's any other resources you think are relevant, include
   them (using a link).

 - If there's things remaining to be done, like tests or documentation,
   or even details to discuss, include [a checklist][se3]. Tick it off
   as stuff is done. In non-github settings, you may also mention these,
   but obviously you'll have to "tick them off" by replying to the list.

## Copyright & Release

### LICENSE and contributor agreements

Take care of reading the LICENSE file as well as any contributor
agreements that may be required. These are legal documents and you
will be bound by them!

You should at least recognise a [few][c3] [of][c4] [the][c5] [most][c6]
[common][c7] [ones][c8] and read them once or twice fully with a calm
head to understand what they are and how they bind you and others.
That will make it easier in the future and save time.

### ~~Public Domain release~~

**Update 13 Feb 2016:** This is not applicable anymore.

~~Most of *my* projects are released in the Public Domain (or licensed under
[CC0][c1] if applicable). To keep the projects free of legal trouble, you
should include this statement (inspired by the [CC0 waiver][c2]) in your
first pull request (I do not actually enforce this all the time):~~

## Style

You should respect the style of both code and comments. You'll have
looked at the code, you'll be able to notice how things are done. Do
not try to put your own style over the code, and especially do not
"re-style" the existing code, even if you think it's bad. There might
be a reasoning behind things being done this way or that, there might
not.

If you have an issue with the style, open an issue or have a talk
(over e.g. IRC, email, chat, in person…) with the maintainers and be
explicit about what you're not happy with, or what you think could be
improved. Mention that you would be willing to do the fix-up work. That
gives them an opportunity to think about it, even maybe submit it for
discussion with the community, and that gives you the opportunity to
chat and make yourself known as a willing and opiniated (it's not a bad
thing, if held in moderation) contributor.

### Linting

There might be a linting tool and configuration with the project. Run
it. Fix everything *before* submitting anything. If you can't fix
something because it would break the code or make it overly ugly, leave
it as-is and mention it in the pull request. Go further and make sure
(if the maintainers forget about it) it is fixed either in your code
or in the linting configuration before your commits get merged. Some
projects include linting as part of their CI strategy. If that's the
case, your commits could break the CI for what could be a simple silly
stylistic mistake.

### Style guide

If the project has a style guide, respect it. It might go further than
just linting. Maintainers may not always look out for style mistakes,
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. It will not only make your code
look better and in harmony with the rest of the project, it will also
make you known for respecting the guidelines, which avoids making the
maintainers work overtime fixing style points.


## Tests

You should write tests if you can. If you can't, or aren't sure, or
want immediate feedback, submit the pull request mention that you
didn't write them. If you want assistance, say so. If you don't have
time, say so. If you think you'll have time in a day or a week, say so.

In other words, if you haven't written tests, explain why and mention
when you'll add them in, if you're planning to. In any case, run the
existing test suite *before* submitting anything. This is similar to
the style thing: if there's problems, fix them. If you can't, say so.

__If the project has no tests__, do *not* add some in without asking.
As with style, there might be a reason. If the project is using
exclusively behaviour tests, don't add unit tests, and vice versa.
If you think there would be a benefit to using a different kind of
tests, again, as always, say so. As architects say:

"If in doubt, ask."


## Support

Projects have different ways of communicating. Usually the README
will have them listed. If it's a Github project, open an issue. If
it's a Bitbucket, Sourceforge, Google Code, etc. project, open an
issue. If there is any obvious way to open an issue, well, you know
what to do. If there's a mailing list / newsgroup for the project,
send a mail. If there's an email for the maintainers, send a mail.
If you're really desperate about finding an email address, look in
the commit metadata (`git log`): the authors' email should be there.

Look on various networks. There might be a Facebook page for the
project. There might be a Twitter account. There might be a channel
on Freenode.

### Support etiquette

Open source projects are mostly run by volunteers and people giving
their free time. Be clear and concise, and be patient. If you're
asking on IRC, stick around, maybe even come back later. Never assume
anyone is going to be around at the same time you are. There's a lot
of timezones in the world, and even if you know the maintainer lives
in, say, Austria, they might not have a typical daily schedule, or
they might be traveling to, say, Canada. Wait at least 48h.

### Be courteous.

If someone cannot understand you, they're likely to pay less attention.

This does not apply if you're not proficient in the language and trying
to be understood. If you don't think you can get express yourself
correctly, e.g. because you don't know what the technical terms translate
to, say so, and include an explanation in your native language — if the
maintainer has time and goodwill, she might seek out a translation.

On the other hand, if you're not being courteous (that's not synonymous
to respect; you can despise someone and still be courteous if you wish),
or if you are unwilling to express yourself in a clear manner, your time
might be wasted as one may just ignore you completely, or even file you
under junkmail.

Similarly, don't be dismissive of comments, especially if they ask for
you to fix things. Your work is not the Holy Graal, it may need refining
and modifying, getting angry because a maintainer does not see your work
as an untouchable masterpiece is more likely to see your PR closed and
your time wasted than it is to make things better.

### Codes of Conduct

Many projects, venues, and other places, physical, virtual, or otherwise,
are adopting or have adopted Codes of Conduct. Respecting them is an
integral part of interacting with the communities they apply to. A lot of
what is in such Codes may seem fairly obvious, but do understand they
exist for a reason. Besides codifying what kind of interactions is deemed
unacceptable by the community, they define processes to allow people a
clear way to report problems and request review, attention, and moderation.
