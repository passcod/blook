What, did you think there was something to win? Life isn't about winning, kid.

Regarding the prisoner dilemma problem we found in Yao's protocol, well, I think it could be 'resolved' in the socialist variant by simulating a kind of reverse binary search. A provides value X, which is constant, but B provides value Yn ∈ {0, ∞, M1, M2, M3, ..., Yreal, Mn, Mn+1, Mn+2, ...} where there are a random number of M values before and after Yreal, and each M is a random number. Then the last packet B sends is N, the position at which Yreal was really compared. Thus, by doing the double instance and synchronisation through C, the only way [here is where I realised I was wrong]

This game is open to all who wish. It usually runs for a week. If, after one week, the game has not been decided, play might continue, but players might lose interest and/or concede defeat to go and play another game. Thus you are advised to distribute Renown Points around the sixth or seventh day.
