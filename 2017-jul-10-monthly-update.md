## List

I watched [Neil Gaiman speaking to students][commencement-speech] last week, and
it reminded me that I did have specific things I've wanted to do forever. Unlike
Gaiman, though, I've never noted them anywhere, so I'll search my memories and
write them down here as I find them again:

 - I want to invent something.
 - I want to publish a scientific paper.
 - I want to forge a blade.
 - I want to travel to Antarctica.
 - I want to pilot a glider.
 - I want to learn a martial art with a staff.
 - I want to build a giant machine.
 - I want to live in a lighthouse for a bit.
 - I want to publish a novel.

## End of a job

This has been a very _very_ busy month, and absolutely exhausting. Due to the
large amounts of operational knowledge I had accumulated without opportunity to
pass it on at my last job, as well as no less than **three** last minute
large-scale migrations that I needed to be part of to ensure a smooth move, I
spent my last month at McKay flat out trying to document and finish everything
right up to my last day.

I was very happy to be done with it all!

## Start of a new one

I started at Uber (not the taxi company) last week. It's going TBC.

## Much writing

I'm nearly finished with the full first draft of the first story in the "In The
Darkness of Dawn" universe Star Wars fanfic. This one is also canon-compliant,
ignoring some small references to future dawnverse stories, and stands fairly
well alone even if you've only seen the films.

Once done, I'll do one or two editing passes myself, before either publishing
outright or finding some advance/beta readers for more feedback.

## Fanfiction

 - {HP/Thor/Dr Who} [Of Wizards and Heroes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136).

   This was great! Perfectly suited to a fresh start in fanfic after three weeks
   not reading anything new. Humour and epic battle, with a last-minute third
   crossover adding yet another dimension to an already
   bendingly-parallel-worlds story. {94k words}

 - {HP} [Whispers in Corners](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255). {64k words}
 - {HP/Merlin} [Emrys Ascending](https://archiveofourown.org/works/932981). {111k words}
 - {HP/Thor} [Spellist](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507). {2k words}

 - {HP} [Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080).

   Not usually a genre of fanfic I read, but in some ways it works? A flurry of
   others like it below, before I went back to more class stuff. {14k words}

 - {HP} [no place like home](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786). {13k words}
 - {HP} [love is touching souls (surely you touched mine)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5937535). {34k words}
 - {HP} [Newts](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6093769). {14k words}
 - {HP} [Temptation on the Warfront](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594). {180k words}
 - {HP} [Reparatio](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5987962). {17k words}

 - {HP} [Stealing Harry](https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408).

   Good and sweet. _Very_ old fic, early 2000s according to the notes, but it
   survived this long, hmm? Some sequels below. {100k words}
