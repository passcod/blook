Prior to Saturday 13th February 2016, all my works were, by default,
released in the Public Domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0.

This is no longer the case.

While many of my works still remain in the public domain, and a large
amount are under permissive licenses, new works are not automatically
released.

All versions of the Blanket License, as described in the BLANKET.txt file
in this directory, are cancelled, nulled, voided, revoked, and the such.
