## Me and the dark always

I drafted a game called **Me and the dark always** that tries to go against the
general practice / consequence of current designs that the "looking" action in
games is free. It ended up being a slice-of-life game concept which deals with
tiredness through a few aspects.

I've got most of the mechanics drawn up, some basic art sketches, the story
elements for a limited demo, and some vision down. I have a rough idea of the
high-level implementation. I'm aiming to continue developing the idea _on paper_
until Yule, then trying for a first playable in early 2018.

## Naema

In early July, I got inspiration for writing some of the chapters that were
missing from the first draft. In mid-July I rewrote the entire outline and
added a lot more details, revealing that for consistency and pacing I had at
least a bunch more chapters of material to write, and a bunch more things
to add in existing chapters.

I continued adding to and revising the outline throughout the month and even
amended it today, and this week, and last week. It's a much more _living_
document, now.

In early August, the outline and its detailed timeline let me catch a profound
anachronicity in a reference to future characters I had thought so clever to
include but had actually messed up by _fifteen years_, so it's definitely
helping!

Before, I estimated this work to go for about 20-25k words. It looks like it's
going more for the 50k mark. But it's a much better work than I ever imagined,
so that's ok.

Writing pace has picked up, and my goal (which I think is generous) is to start
publishing in December at the latest. I'll probably spend NaNoWriMo doing final
revisions and polish, if that's the case. If I finish earlier, who knows?

I published the prologue (and first bit of Naema I'd written) [on AO3][edot].

## Job

New job is going good. Got my first "boring" project this week, a refactor with
little in the way of exciting parts. It's a bit tedious, but it's also nice and
calm and methodical work. DT and SB provide good distractions and liven up the
place. Not a dull day passes, with these two!

## Nþ

I accidentally used “þ” instead of “th” in a tweet, but I like it! I think I'll
use it more, and not accidentally.

## Cogitare

I started on a redesign of the plotbot for NaNoWriMo. More news next month!

## Fanfiction

As usual, only "good enough to be listed" newly-read fics are, well, listed, and
not everything I've read during the month. Especially recommended fics are in
**bold**.

 - {HP} [the family potter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861). {10k words}
 - {HP} **[There May Be Some Collateral Damage](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443)**. {61k words}
 - {HP/Buffy} [It's All Relative on the Hellmouth](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2985538). {112k words}
 - {LotR/HP} [The Shadow of Angmar](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934). {154k words atow}
 - {HP} **[The Black Prince](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283)**. {139k words atow}

 - {HP} **[A Long Journey Home](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311)**.

   The premise is the most interesting I've read in a while, even in the already
   crowded genre of time travel, and even counting time travel closing-the-loop
   fics of the same order of magnitude on the time scale. Which, by the way,
   another very good fic which comes close to the premise and scale is one
   recommended last month, the _Of a Linear Circle_ series.

   However, _A Long Journey Home_ shines by its radically different
   story-telling, a sequence of extended vignettes in the long life of one
   Jasmine Potter, showing many stories and histories, each standing alone with
   grace and yet much richer for its part in the whole. The theories and
   explorations its characters go through, both personally and of magic, are
   rendered beautifully and yet without glamouring or wonderwashing, and without
   the praise-science-preach-science approach of ‘conventional’ rationalist
   fiction.

   And yes, this _is_ rationalist fiction, but embedded in great writing as an
   integral part of the work, instead of using the work as a mere transport.
