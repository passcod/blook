## Donations

Every year that I am able to, I try to give a sizeable portion of my salary
away in donations to various organisations and charities I believe make the
world a better place.

All amounts are in NZ dollars, even if the donation was in another currency.

### Patreon

Aside from my 5% donations, I also gave $xxx to various creators on Patreon.


## Fanfiction

### Written

 - [How to Fall to the Dark Side in Ten Minutes and Save Jerks from Themselves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13125189/chapters/30026574)

### Read

Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don't include fics I read but didn't like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn't include all
I read that _wasn't_ fanfic.
