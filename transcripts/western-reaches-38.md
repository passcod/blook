__Megan: [00:00:00]__ Hello, welcome back to Western Reaches: Tosche Station's
grab-bag geek discussion focusing on science-fiction and fantasy books and
videogames.

__Megan: [00:00:52]__ Saf and I've been on hiatus over the summer, but now
we're back with a goal of sticking to a monthly schedule going forward, for as
long as that continues to be pleasant for us. We've also been working on a lot
of creative projects over the summer, so this episode we're going to talk about
what we've playing and what we've been reading and also about how being
creators has changed the way we look at fandom.

__Megan: [00:01:13]__ Hey Saf, it's been a while!

__Saf: [00:01:15]__ It has been quite a while, yeah.

__Saf: [00:01:17]__ I was looking at the last episode it was April, I was like
"Wow, so much has happened since then.".

__Megan: [00:01:22]__ Basically, I'm judging my entire life around the cycle of
Destiny events right now. So yeah. That was before we had the latest DLC. It
was before we knew any of this Forsaken stuff.

__Saf: [00:01:41]__ Even before Warmind?

__Megan: [00:01:42]__ I'm not sure — I was gonna say I think so but I didn't
want to be wrong.

__Saf: [00:01:46]__ I think it is because Warmind came out right around when I
went to America, which think was in April — I could be very wrong, I'm really
bad at dates.

__Megan: [00:01:59]__ I think I definitely feel like something happened in
April that was Disney-related. So,.

__Saf: [00:02:06]__ Wait no, actually I went to America in May. See what I
meant? I'm bad at dates.

__Megan: [00:02:13]__ Looks like it's mid-May.

__Megan: [00:02:15]__ Well. Great, great start.

__Saf: [00:02:19]__ Good thing we are not Destiny newspeople giving people
updates on what's coming in this field because we would be very bad at that.

__Megan: [00:02:27]__ I would be more prepared for that, I like to think, but
right now I'm clearly not wearing my Destiny news hat.

__Megan: [00:02:41]__ So, all I've been doing is playing Gambit. So you can ask
me any question you want about Gambit. And we're going to talk about that
later!

__Saf: [00:02:49]__ Absolutely.

__Megan: [00:02:49]__ First, we're going to do our normal sections:

__Megan: [00:02:54]__ So, first we're going to talk about books. This is a
little unusual because we have been away for the summer so these are going to
be things that we've read any time between May and now. This is obviously not
like everything you've read, but when I was going through working there what I
had read, the ones that stood out to me were either books that I really loved
or that I was, or had been really excited for because I knew the series, knew
the author, and some of these were things I ended up covering on Den of Geek.
I've gotten more involved with their books department and also kind of more
comfortable with saying like: "you're a voice that I think needs to be
magnified" or "here's an independent publisher that doesn't do a lot of
promotion and like we should kind of work with them and talk about their book
more" because mostly I'm talking about **[Latchkey]** because I loved it and no
one talks about it.

__Megan: [00:03:52]__ Latchkey is the sequel to **[Archivist Wasp]** by
**Nicole Kornher-Stace**. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world with ghosts and
priestesses whose job is to capture the ghosts. This one set, well obviously
after the Archivist Wasp, but it's set primarily in this one town that's being
besieged.

__Megan: [00:04:19]__ It's both the story of a bunch of people trying to
protect their town, and Wasps, or Ysabel going through the remnants of
basically a superhero or like Spartan training facility and learning about what
happened in the past of her world.

__Megan: [00:04:36]__ And, it's so good. I think I've said before that this
series is practically made for me, because it is very much like Halo, it's very
much like a superhero stories. I think she was inspired a little bit by Fallout
as well and then it also has this supernatural element and it's all about
fierce teenage girls and girls being friends. And she was very specific, very
careful to say that she specifically wanted it not to be a romance story. She
didn't want any of that to be central, and I really like that about it. So this
is the sequel. I'd definitely recommend it. I love Archivist Wasp, but I think
I've talked about that before, so all I can say is: please please check it out.
It's so good.

__Saf: [00:05:24]__ Question: Should I read Archivist Wasp before Latchkey. I
feel like I should.

__Megan: [00:05:31]__ Yes. Yes.

__Saf: [00:05:31]__ Okay. I'm going to request it from the library right now.

__Megan: [00:05:34]__ They definitely follow each other. They are from
independent publishers: Archivist Wasp was published by **Small Beer Press**,
which I remember specifically because I've visited them at a book festival
yesterday. Latchkey was published by a different publisher, which I _should_
remember because I worked with them a little bit... but I can't right now.
{`trans`: it was **Mythic Delirium**}

__Megan: [00:06:00]__ So our great theme of not being able to remember things
continues. I'll get back to you on that one.

__Saf: [00:06:09]__ Okay.

__Megan: [00:06:10]__ Yes, so it's a different publisher, but they both have
pretty easy access. You can get them as ebooks, you can get them at the
library.

__Saf: [00:06:15]__ Awesome. Yeah. Well I can get them at my library
apparently, so. If you can get them in New Zealand you can find them anywhere.
Hopefully.

__Megan: [00:06:24]__ When I was making this list I discovered that it was 80
percent female writers, which is awesome although I didn't intend to do that.
But another one that I read this summer that was specifically about, y'know
that "strong female character" label, that had a very distinct lady lead... was
**[Trail of Lightning]** by **Rebecca Roanhorse**, which is the first in a
fantasy series about a monster hunter and these sort of — ah, what's really
unique about it is her character is Navajo and it's based on Native American
legend and Native American stories as well as the experience of living as
colonized people who have then regained their sovereignty in the world.

__Megan: [00:07:16]__ And I might not be explaining that very well. I
definitely recommend it. [I interviewed Rebecca Roanhorse for Den of
Geek][rr-interview], so please go listen to that, in her own words.

__Megan: [00:07:26]__ She wanted to see a native protagonist and she wrote one.
Maggie Hoskie is really cool and she has a kind of anxiety that manifests in a
way that was very relevant to me. She's a very strong character. She also has a
lot of depth to her and a lot of kinda {inaudible}.

__Megan: [00:07:56]__ I'm not describing super well because it has been a
while, but I really enjoyed the imagery in this book, and it also has a person
— like I don't think a lot of people have read a lot of Native
American-inspired fantasy actually written by a person from that heritage. I
think that's relatively rare right now. It was really unique to see someone
with that voice and someone with — there's a lot of really justified anger in
this book, and one of the things that the author talks about is it's a
post-apocalyptic book but: the apocalypse already happened for Native American
people. Like when the settlers arrived. I learned a lot from this book that I
had not ever thought about before and that's — I think something that's really
remarkable about it. It's something that maybe shouldn't have taken a fantasy
book for me to learn, but that was a vector for that for me. So I'll definitely
recommend that. It's part of a series. There's also — she's going to have a
high fantasy series coming out in the future which I'm really keeping an eye
on.

__Saf: [00:09:06]__ One thing I think, like. You said that "it shouldn't have
taken a fantasy book to teach you those things" but I think sometimes,
especially with how things are very whitewashed and a lot of history is hidden
from us... because it's bad. Sometimes it kinda needs to be something you
engage with because it's something you must engage with normally, like a book
like a fiction book or something that kind of teaches you these things about
the past. Because... fiction, even though it's fiction, still carries a lot of
like actual historical truth in it. Expecially when you read outside of "white
male fiction". And I think it's kind of an important part of reading and
talking about more marginalized fiction.

__Megan: [00:10:09]__ Yeah, same. Yeah. As far as my experience has been I
would say that's true and in general of course it's basically that people who
want to write sci-fi and fantasy, who grew up on sci-fi and fantasy and haven't
seen themselves explicitly expressed in it before... are writing those books
now and seeing those things now. And I think that's really cool.

__Saf: [00:10:33]__ Yeah, me too.

__Megan: [00:10:35]__ Which, I think, that that's partially what our network is
built on. I like to think that that can be assumed. I don't want to be like,
pat myself on the back, like "we're so diverse". No, but, y'know. Diversity
should be the norm. I'm glad that it's getting to the point where it can be.

__Saf: [00:11:02]__ Yeah agreed.

__Megan: [00:11:04]__ In terms of expressing... Kind of putting yourself into a
story, one of the books that I just finished but really loved because I had to
put it on the list was: **[The Mere Wife]** by **Maria Dahvana Headley**. Which
is a retelling, a very loose retelling, of the story of Beowulf. Set in a gated
community. And I didn't pick this up at first, I had seen so many ads for it,
it was very well marketed, there were ads all over the place, but I thought
that it wouldn't be fantasy enough for me because it is partially about sort of
the high society of this gated community. A woman who is the heiress to this
community serves the role of the master — in this, the mistress — of Heorot
Hall, and then Beowulf is a police officer who ends up getting involved with
this.

__Megan: [00:12:04]__ His name is Ben Wolf and it took me like five chapters to
realize that it was, like, that was who he was.

__Megan: [00:12:16]__ And then Grendel is the son of a veteran who comes home
and has horrific PTSD and ends up living in the mountains next to this gated
community. So it is a little bit about the families. It's a little bit about
the lands and it's just beautifully written.

__Megan: [00:12:41]__ The perspective includes what the author calls a
collective perspective. So she writes from the point of view of five women
using third person plural. And then she does the same thing from the point of
view of the mountain using third person plural. And it's so good, it's very
beautiful, I just want to stare at her paragraphs and take them apart and see
how she does some of what she does in it. I was afraid that this would be too
literary for me. I was afraid it would be dry. But the writing itself elevates
it so much and I think if you like literary fantasy. Like it's not an action
story, you know. But if you like literary flavor fantasy it definitely lives up
to the hype.

__Saf: [00:13:33]__ Yeah originally I kept seeing ads for it on the Kindle that
I was using, and I was like "ah, I'll pick it up". But... I'll probably give a
look because I love — I mean I'm not so much a fantasy person but I'm always
here for beautiful writing.

__Megan: [00:13:49]__ I think you would like it. Really because I think you
would feel that the writing style is very instructive and very inspiring.

__Saf: [00:14:00]__ Yeah. I'm going to check it out. It's on my list of books
to read right now. It sounds really cool. Like not particularly my thing but it
sounds like something I'd like anyways.

__Megan: [00:14:09]__ It's funny, the friend of mine who recommended it to me
came at it from the opposite perspective, she usually likes literary fiction
and was afraid that it would be too fantasy for her so we had this
meeting-in-the-middle and both loving it.

__Saf: [00:14:24]__ That's really cool.

__Megan: [00:14:26]__ The other thing that was really interesting about it was
that it is an adaptation. The author is also currently working on a translation
of Beowulf and she has a lot of feelings about how the translations have been
used to skew the story over the years.

__Megan: [00:14:48]__ There is a thing that I learned when I learned Beowulf in
college that I kept waiting for it to come up in this book and it finally did
and I was like _yesss_. It was the most interesting part of this. I mean it
took one class on it, I'm not a scholar in any way but I think if you read it
you would get a lot out of it.

__Megan: [00:15:08]__ And also — I haven't really thought about the idea of
this as an adaptation because — I guess specifically as an adaptation or an
from a passion. So specifically born from an idea that she wanted to create
female characters that could be strong and could express her ideas about what
strength is and about what being a monster is, and all those impulses. It
reminds me very much of the kind of "what ifs", like what a fanfiction writer
does. And I don't necessarily want to say... I don't think adaptation is
fanfiction, I think that those are... Y'know we could go down a rabbit trail
and have them there and find out but I don't want to do that right now... But I
do think that some of the impulses might be similar. And as a writer I was like
"I can learn from that. I can apply that." I can be kind of — you're always
being given permission to do things from the people come before, right? Ideally
you're doing something new, you are creating your own trail, you're creating
unique stories, but there's also real freedom in seeing... Like "oh this is
_allowed_."

__Megan: [00:16:23]__ And this was one of those books that made me feel like:
Oh, you're allowed to write about, y'know, women who stand in suburbs and feel
like they have claws, and you're allowed to do that while referencing this
poem, this epic poem about a monster and... It was just all very good.

__Saf: [00:16:44]__ That sounds incredibly cool.

__Megan: [00:16:51]__ Yeah, I'm picking and choosing things, but definitely
these have all been great. I want to switch to one that I liked less,
especially because you also read **[Revenant Gun]**, which is the third book in
the **[The Machineries of Empire]** series, which I _adore_. And the third one
came out in the summer, I was super excited for it, and I didn't like it. And
that was partially because I had latched on to certain characters that I didn't
feel were given the correct due in a very fannish sense, and also partially
because of the actual plot stuff and I can say, well, here's where I think like
the writing wasn't strong or whatever, and I do want to go into that but I also
want to hear what you thought, because you read it as well and you had like
really high expectations as well. So: what did you think?

__Saf: [00:17:49]__ I had a similar thing with latching on to characters that
didn't really get much attention in this final book. Um, I can't remember any
of their names, because it's been a while but there was like , the captain of
the ship —.

__Megan: [00:18:02]__ Cheris?

__Saf: [00:18:02]__ Cheris was definitely one of them, but this is the captain
of the ship from the previous book?

__Megan: [00:18:07]__ Oh! Yeah. Khiruev.

__Saf: [00:18:10]__ Right, yeah. I loved Khiruev and you barely get any time of
her in this, after being a main character in the previous book, which kind of
made me sad, cause I want more of Khiruev's adventures, basically. Both
separately and together. I liked the dynamic that got built in the previous
book and I'm kind of sad that this kind of got pushed aside for this book. So
yeah, I kind of had similar feelings, like there were things that I thought
could have been done better, but all in all I liked it. I didn't come out of it
being disappointed because it wasn't the sequel or the finale I expected, but
it also wasn't as strong as the other books, for me.

__Megan: [00:18:51]__ Yeah, I would say I did come out of it disappointed. I
don't think it was bad at the sentence level, but I felt that Cheris was hardly
even present, and the story that was told instead of finishing her story was
about a character that I never really latched on to. And it was sort of just
like endless terrible things kept happening to him, and whenever you thought
something good was happening you'd later find out that, no, that was also
terrible. I was just kind of tired by the end. Just like "let this kid rest!"

__Saf: [00:19:34]__ Yeah. I was really disappointed that there wasn't Cheris in
it. It kind of just became all, what's his name, new Jedao. And we're talking
about him, and his tragic past, and all that stuff and I was like "oh ok". Like
I like it all, but I love Cheris. Cheris is a really cool character and I'm sad
that she didn't get a proper final arc in this.

__Megan: [00:20:08]__ Yeah. This one left me wanting to rewrite it.

__Saf: [00:20:11]__ Especially after the ending of the previous book.

__Megan: [00:20:20]__ I do think the author fell a bit too much in love with
his own ideas about the backstory and needed to be told "Okay, like, we get it
now." But what interests us is more the present day though.

__Saf: [00:20:36]__ Definitely agree on that one. There was way too much
backstory flashback stuff.

__Megan: [00:20:41]__ Well I'm glad to hear that you thought so too. I don't
know — it really — like, oh my gosh I had so many feelings about Cheris and old
Jedao, the original, that I was like: "Am I consuming this book wrong,
basically? Did I not understand what was going on in the previous ones?" But
no, I think this one was just different.

__Saf: [00:21:07]__ Yeah, I think it was. I think you're very much right that
he kind of fell in love too much with Jedao and his background and stuff like
that and the other guy — I can't remember the characters' names, it's been so
long! — that Cheris kind of got forgotten.

__Megan: [00:21:24]__ And there's supposed to be more of this, there was
supposed to be a short story coming that might be about Cheris. So we live in
hope.

__Saf: [00:21:30]__ We can hope. We can — we can hope.

__Megan: [00:21:34]__ So. The last one that I wanted to talk about, probably
pretty briefly, is **[A Closed and Common Orbit]** by **Becky Chambers**. Over
the summer I read both of the sequels to — wait, no. I was gonna say **[A
Swiftly Tilting Planet]** and that's not it. **[The Long Way to a Small, Angry
Planet]**, that's it.

__Megan: [00:21:53]__ That's two **Madeleine L'Engle** references in two
podcasts, look at that!

__Megan: [00:22:01]__ So it's The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet. It was
followed by two sequels, both of which I enjoyed immensely. A Close and Common
Orbit is a book that I put off reading for a while because it was about an AI
learning to become their own independent being, and I was a little afraid that
that would get really tropeian, really cheesy, but I really liked it. It was
excellent found family story, I really liked the aliens. My biggest problem
with Angry Planet was that it felt too much like Firefly, whereas this one felt
very much like a unique universe.

__Megan: [00:22:39]__ So, if you want, it would be a great beach read, it would
be a great comfort read. It is very emotionally open, and very emotionally
understanding, and takes care with the effects and, like, um.

__Megan: [00:23:00]__ As you can see, I'm not in touch with my emotions today.

__Megan: [00:23:11]__ It talks about the way characters' emotions affect them
over long term not just short term, and I really liked reading it.

__Saf: [00:23:18]__ Right, yes, that's an approach that's not really taken in a
lot of books.

__Megan: [00:23:26]__ It actually reminded me of the **[Updraft]** series a
little bit, in that way. In that it almost seemed like it was a video game. It
would have like a stamina bar, and how much stamina your character had was very
important.

__Saf: [00:23:41]__ Yeah, that makes sense.

__Megan: [00:23:44]__ So. That's all I have. What have you been up to?

__Saf: [00:23:49]__ Oh god it's my turn now. Um. Geez.

__Saf: [00:23:53]__ There are a few books here and I've forgotten the names of
all the characters in all the books, so I apologise for that in advance.

__Megan: [00:24:01]__ We're both a bit rusty.

__Saf: [00:24:03]__ Yeah yeah. I don't exactly...

__Saf: [00:24:07]__ I've been churning through books, because I basically broke
my knee not long after we recorded our last episode. So I churned through a lot
of books while recovering, because there wasn't much else I could do but read.
So I just picked out a few, Megan, because I don't want to talk about
everything. Not everything's worth talking about, honestly. I read a book
called **Trigger Happy** {`trans`: there's about fifteen books named that and I
have no idea which trashy one it is. No link for you!}. It was trash. I knew it
was gonna be trash going in, but it was _extreme_ trash.

__Megan: [00:24:34]__ That title is all you need to know. Oh my gosh, how
evocative. Yeah. Tell me nothing else about it.

__Saf: [00:24:38]__ I will not. I promise I will not.

__Saf: [00:24:41]__ But I was in hospital. I read a book called **[Semiosis]**
which I was reading before I ended up in hospital, that I end up finishing in
hospital because I had nothing else to do. It came out relatively recently by
someone — Susan Burke or something like that? **Sue Burke**? I don't remember —
which is about some colonisers, well, they don't consider themselves colonisers
because they are basically leaving Earth with the intention to fit themselves
into another planet's ecosystem, like find a niche they can fit in, in another
planet's ecosystem, so that they don't use up all the reasons or anything and
they just kind of fit in. So they head off to this planet to do that, and they
end up finding this sentient plant, or like a bunch of sentient plants that are
basically fighting each other, and they kind of befriend one of the plants? I
won't really say befriend, they kind of serve the niche of looking after that
plant, and it looks after them. So it kind of becomes a symbiotic thing. And so
the story's about like the different generations of the civilisation as they
grow up with us these plants that can think and interact with them, and the
choices they make, and stuff like that. And it's also about the plant and how
the plant grows.

__Saf: [00:25:54]__ And I was really excited about this book, I was like "ooh,
sentient plant, that's gonna be really weird aliens stuff." But the plot, that
plot ends up being very humanised and it kind of upset me. Like at some point
it gets gendered as a _him_ and I was like "it's a plant! It doesn't matter
what its gender is." ...as I tend to do when I'm reading things about weird
alien stuff.

__Saf: [00:26:11]__ And it turns into a very humanised kind of plot. It's like
reading one of those AI stories where AI just becomes human with human emotions
and everything. Like "Oh I've discovered myself." So I was a little bit
disappointed with that, especially because I had just read **[Planetfall]**.

__Megan: [00:26:37]__ It absolutely sounds a little bit like Planetfall.

__Saf: [00:26:38]__ Yes so I was going in expecting kind of the weirdness you
get from Planetfall, and it just wasn't weird enough. I mean, people seem to be
liking, it's got good reviews, and I keep seeing it on recommended shelves in
libraries. But I prefer my weird sci-fi to be a bit weirder, so I was a little
bit disappointed by that.

__Megan: [00:26:59]__ Yeah, that sounds like it's exactly what I didn't want A
Closed and Common Orbit to be.

__Saf: [00:27:05]__ Yeah possibly. Yeah. I just want some more weird alien
plant stuff. It probably doesn't help as well because I've read **[Children of
God]** not long before that. So I had a couple really good weird sci-fi kind of
things with good interpretations of alternate, like how things on different
planets would grow and act. And then I go to this book and it was like "yes,
everything is like humans, but they're plants." And I was like: nah, nah, I
don't like that.

__Saf: [00:27:31]__ It did have some cool ideas, the writing was pretty good.
It wasn't breathtakingly good, but was pretty good, and had some cool ideas,
and I really liked some of the characters and the choices they made. It was
just the plot that disappointed me.

__Megan: [00:27:45]__ Especially if you'd been reading things with like really
_alien_ aliens before that. I can see how that would be disappointing.

__Saf: [00:27:51]__ It's a good thing I didn't read **[Grass]** right before
that, because that would have definitely ramped up my expectations for weird
plans.

__Megan: [00:28:00]__ Oh gosh, yeah. I can definitely see the connection. I
just remembered how much I loved Grass.

__[00:28:06]__ Yeah I get that. For the first time I read it I was like "oh god
I love Grass." Maybe I should reread that. I also read **[The Will To
Battle]**. Which I think I might have read before that. I don't actually
remember when I was reading this book. It was at some point. No it was when I
had my leg brace, so it was well into my recovery. There we go. So handy. What
a good frame of reference in my mind.

__[00:28:29]__ It is the third book. Ah, I can't remember what the other books
are called. **[Too Like the Lightning]**! It's by **Ada Palmer**. It's the
third book after Too Like the Lightning, which I talked about a while back when
I read it, and it's also a sequel I can't remember the name of the second book.

__Megan: [00:28:42]__ I remember you saying that you didn't like it very much.
You wanted to like it but it didn't do it for you.

__Saf: [00:28:48]__ Yeah! And yet I still keep on picking up the books. It's
because — I swear to god this keeps happening to me — I thought the first book
was a standalone, so I picked it up and I read it through. And I was like OK,
cool. And I got like, I don't know, 10 pages from the end, and was like
"there's no way this book can wrap up in the 10 pages, there's going to be a
sequel, isn't it?" And so then, there was a sequel. And it was like "the story
will be continued in this next book." And I was like "okay, cool. I'llgrab the
next book and finish the story and I'll be free."

__Saf: [00:29:12]__ And then I got two pages to the end of that book and I was
like "hang on a second.".

__Megan: [00:29:15]__ Haha, you're trapped.

__Saf: [00:29:16]__ "Is this a trilogy? Is this a trilogy?!"

__Saf: [00:29:20]__ And then it was like "this will continue in The Will to
Battle" and I was like "okay I guess I'll read that." So I requested it from
the library and got it when it came out, and I got ten pages from the end there
and I was like "hang on a second." It turns out it's not a trilogy, as I
assumed it was, and there's a fourth book coming out which I _think_ is that
last book. But I cannot actually...

__Megan: [00:29:39]__ You requested it, though. You didn't give up.

__Saf: [00:29:43]__ No. Because by that point I was in too deep.

__Saf: [00:29:45]__ And to be fair, because I'm in this deep I actually really
care about the worldbuilding and the politics of the story. I don't care at all
about any of the characters. They're all extremely unlikable. None of them are
realistic. Nobody acts like a real human. But I really like the politics and so
I get really interested in the world of the story. Like when I was reading it I
would like — because I _read_ and my flatmates tend to be around me, and I get
really into books as I read them so I like swear and stuff so I'll be like "oh
my god I can't believe they did that!" Like I actively vocally react to books.

__Saf: [00:30:20]__ And so there were a couple times I was like "oh my god, I
can't believe they did that!" and my flatmates are like "What the hell is she
talking about." And I'll try and explain the book to them and they'd be like
"okay, Saf, have fun with that.".

__Saf: [00:30:28]__ But there was a really cool concept in it which is. Like
the different, I forgot, "hives" I think? I don't remember what they're called.
Different nations. It's like the nation-state idea has disappeared in this
future world, because there's like flying cars and people can get anywhere
pretty much instantaneously or within a couple hours. So the idea of country
nations is gone. And so basically there are nations that you can opt into and
they become your nation.

__Saf: [00:30:55]__ And one of them is called Utopia which is basically...
They're utopians and they basically have a very optimistic view of the future.
They want to go into space and do the stuff. And they don't kill without need.
They're very cool. I very much love the Utopians and they all wear these, I
can't remember what it's called, but it's a material, they all wear cloaks that
are of this material, that displays the future that that Utopian sees.

__Saf: [00:31:22]__ So like one of them has like ants everywhere on his,
because I think he loves ants. I don't remember why, but he just has ants all
over his. And one of them shows flying castles or stuff like that. Like they
show us whatever world they believe in, on their cloaks.

__Megan: [00:31:40]__ Interesting. So like a screen or a hologram?

__Saf: [00:31:41]__ Yeah. It's like they're cloaks that can also turn them
invisible as well I think like a camouflage, so it basically just shows
whatever they want on it because it's a technological thing. I don't know. They
are the technology nation so they just do all that stuff. And whenever a
Utopian dies, every single Utopian's cloak will just flash bright white for a
few seconds, or become static, I don't remember exactly what it is, but
something like that. So every single Utopian would just do that.

__Saf: [00:32:10]__ And so there was one point in a scene where there's a bunch
of Utopians there, and suddenly that happens, and it's the first time it ever
happened in the books, and I was like "damn, that's real cool." Like it was
just really jarring when it happens, because I was just like "oh shit, I know
what that means." Like I know exactly what it means. And because of the way the
book leads up, you know what that particular death means for the future of the
world.

__[00:32:35]__ So the worldbuilding is extremely cool and I really enjoy it. I
just wish the characters were extremely cool and realistic, because I can't
quite get into the characters, even the main character. Like I'm kind of
attached to him because he's... the main character. But everyone else, I'm like
"I don't care, whatever. Do whatever you want. You're all terrible people."

__Megan: [00:32:55]__ Yeah I definitely get that. Like you wanna just walk
around in that world. Like I just want to put me and my friends in that world,
instead of this these people.

__Saf: [00:33:07]__ Yeah exactly. And I have no clue how these books are gonna
end so I am going to read them. I swear to god the fourth book better be the
last book because. This keeps happening to me. But I am really curious how it
ends now, because I've been I've read three of these books, and I'm quite
invested in the world. So I don't love the books but I am extremely invested in
them. Which is such a weird place to be in, but it's where I'm at.

__Megan: [00:33:26]__ That is a weird place and I can imagine you,
theoretically going up to the author and being like: "Hey I like your books but
you need to stop."

__Megan: [00:33:39]__ I mean obviously we wouldn't do that in reality but it
makes me laugh because it's the opposite of having to wait a long time for a
book you're really excited about. It's like that but you want it to happen so
that it's over.

__Saf: [00:33:52]__ Yeah pretty much. Yeah the day I'm free from these books
will be a good day.

__Megan: [00:33:58]__ That's quite a recommendation.

__Saf: [00:34:02]__ Yeah. There are a lot of friends who do like these books. I
say a lot of friends. I have a couple friends who really like these books. So
they do really have an audience, but I definitely struggled with them. It's a
weird relationship with these books, I don't understand it.

__Saf: [00:34:15]__ But when it comes to books I do really like, well I guess,
short books, novellas. I read some **[Brooke Bolander]** stuff because turns
out Brooke Bolander's an amazing writer, who coulda known?

__Megan: [00:34:30]__ So good. So so good.

__Saf: [00:34:32]__ So I read **[The Only Harmless Great Thing]** and **[No
Flight Without the Shatter]** which are two different short novellas. And it is
both incredibly amazing like Brooke's language is just gorgeous. She writes how
I wish I could write. The way she just describes things is just — she writes
with ambiguity: she doesn't clearly define anything, but the way she writes it
is all about the emotions and the kind of atmosphere of it and you just get
enough of it.

__Saf: [00:34:59]__ So The Only Harmless Great Thing is about kind of combining
two historical events which is: an elephant that got irradiated or something
like that, Topsy the elephant, and then those nuclear girls who were painting
the watches with the radiation stuff with the plutonium? I don't remember what
it's called {`trans`: [The Radium Girls]} with the radiation stuff that glows
so that the watch faces would glow? Who all died because they would use them
lips to like point the brushes, because that was what they were told to do. And
at the time they didn't know that that would kill them all because they were
literally just putting radiation to their mouths. And so it was combining those
two events, basically, to tell a story about being subjugated by capitalism and
how radiation is bad. I make it sound way more bad than it is. But is an
extremely good book.

__Megan: [00:35:58]__ It's accurate, though. You're not wrong.

__Saf: [00:35:59]__ Yeah yeah. It is extremely good. For such a short story it
fits so much emotional weight into it.

__Saf: [00:36:07]__ No Flight Without the Shatter is about a world where humans
have destroyed everything and it's the last of, kind of like, their sole
representation I guess, are like moving on. And it's about humanity and
humanity's ability to destroy or change and... that kind of stuff. And it's so
gorgeously written as well. They're both incredibly good. I think the Harmless
Great Thing I enjoyed the most because: I love elephants, but also: I don't
know, I just— the whole— radiation freaks me out. Like the whole idea of
radiation freaks me out. So that whole book kind of played really well into
that and my brain. And No Flight Without the Shatter felt more like something I
was watching from a distance, if that makes sense, but I really enjoyed it
regardless.

__Megan: [00:37:01]__ I agree completely. The Only Harmless Great Thing had
more of a plot, which I think was was better for it, but I would love to like,
I'd just like to sit Brooke Bolander down and tell her to teach me how to
write.

__Saf: [00:37:17]__ She's seriously oh so right.

__Megan: [00:37:20]__ It's so important that the voice in each of these two
novellas is very unique in a different way. And then she has a short story that
has a completely different voice. I don't even. Her process must just be like—
magical.

__Megan: [00:37:37]__ I mean I read No Flight Without the Shatter, and I was
already kinda sad that day...

__Saf: [00:37:43]__ Oh no!

__Megan: [00:37:43]__ ...and I was just _miserable_.

__Saf: [00:37:49]__ Oh no!

__Megan: [00:37:50]__ It is _not_ a happy ending.

__Saf: [00:37:53]__ Yeah, but it's still a little bit hopeful at the ending,
even it's not happy.

__Megan: [00:37:57]__ You know, that's a really good distinction. I think
you're right.

__Saf: [00:38:00]__ It _is_ extremely sad.

__Megan: [00:38:03]__ Yes. And it's free. I believe you can get it for free.
Right?

__Saf: [00:38:09]__ It was either free or extremely cheap on Kindle. I can't
remember which one it was.

__Megan: [00:38:15]__ I think it might be free on Tor and then you can buy it
for a few dollars on your digital books platform of choice.

__Saf: [00:38:26]__ And here I am giving people I care about money, I guess.

__[00:38:31]__ But yeah, it is generally extremely good and if you haven't
experienced Brooke Bolander's writing I would very much recommend going to read
that, because you'll know it's the right thing. I don't know. I found it very
easily because it was on my library's— because it was on the Mystery Shelf.
That's right! That's why I picked that one out. The Mystery Shelf turned out to
be good for once.

__Saf: [00:38:52]__ I'm excited to get home and get back to that Mystery Shelf.
I went to a library the other day and I literally didn't know what to do,
because there was no Mystery Shelf. So I was just wandering around just like "I
don't know how to pick out a book now. I don't know how to do this." So I ended
up getting 3 books I've already read.

__Megan: [00:39:07]__ You're so used to the universe offering books to you.

__Saf: [00:39:11]__ Exactly.

__Saf: [00:39:14]__ Then I also read **[The Three-Body Problem]**, and the two
books that follow that, which is **[The Dark Forest]** and **[Death's End]**,
because The Three-Body Problem was cheap on my Kindle, like it was really
cheap, on sale. And I really needed something to read and I only had my phone
with me with the Kindle app. So I just got that. And I didn't start reading it
when I needed that, anyways, because I started re-reading another book. But I
eventually picked it up again because I was like "I might as well read it,"
cause I'd run out of books from the library at that moment.

__Saf: [00:39:41]__ And, oh, I fell in real deep with that book. There are
certain books that I get really invested in, and I can _do_ anything but finish
the book. And it's the worse, especially when the book is as thick as these
books. They are very big books. And I'm kind of surprised I got so into it,
because these books are written more like a history than an actual story
happening. So it's kind of a detached way of looking at what's happening in the
books and it's interesting. It's kind of hard to resonate with, sometimes,
because it's so very... the author will just explain things in the most minute
detail, like the science and the maths of things in the most minute detail. And
I'm like: "I know you understand this, but I am stupid and I don't understand
maths."

__Megan: [00:40:36]__ It's right on the edge where hard sci-fi meets an actual
textbook, I think.

__Saf: [00:40:41]__ Yes, absolutely.

__Megan: [00:40:42]__ I liked it. I found it extremely well constructed. I just
didn't enjoy it. I found it too dry, and I didn't read the rest of them. But
looks like you really got into them. I know lots of people got into them.

__Saf: [00:40:59]__ Yeah, I had a bit of trouble with The Dark Forest, because
I think they had a different translater, it wasn't **[Ken Liu]**, so it felt a
bit drier than the other two. But I really liked the first one. Especially once
it hits the trisolar stuff. I was just like "oh my god." So basically these
books was just a process of me being like "oh my god this is even cooler weird
sci-fi." I was reading them to see where it ended, and when I picked the first
book, there's a timeline in the front of the book, with different eras that the
human species goes through and I was looking at this going like "what the hell
are these. I don't understand what this means, but I really want to know.".

__Saf: [00:41:36]__ I don't really care about any of the characters in it, but
the weird sci-fi science stuff was just amazing, and I got really into that
because... it touches on so many sci-fi or real-life space things. I just find
extremely interesting, and it touches on it in quite a well-founded way that's
not like flimsy sci-fi, it's like solid. There's science and stuff in this and
I'm like "wow, this is really cool.".

__Saf: [00:42:06]__ I really really enjoyed it even though, because I can't see
things in my head, I've really struggled with some of that imagery that he was
trying to bring across, because I can't even imagine half the stuff he talks
about. To be sure I'm not sure anyone can, because a lot of is, like in the
latter books, it starts talking about like extra-dimensional stuff, so like "in
the fourth dimension", "in the fifth dimension", and I'm like "I literally do
not. You've gone into too many dimensions, man. I can't do this.".

__Megan: [00:42:33]__ Yes. I remember, I think I wanted diagrams for this book.

__Saf: [00:42:39]__ Yeah, I would really enjoy diagrams, honestly.

__Saf: [00:42:41]__ I read — I watched **[Interstellar]** the other day, some
parts in there, I was like "maybe _that's_ what he was trying to describe.
Maybe it looked like that." So Interstellar turns out — so there's ideas in
there that aren't super far away from some of the ideas in this trilogy. I
mean. In some ways. Visually, particularly. I have no clue. But I really enjoy
them. They're just, whew, quite a lot to get through.

__Megan: [00:43:08]__ So our next topic is going to be games that we played
this summer. And both of us have played a ton of **[Destiny]**.

__Megan: [00:43:15]__ We were talking, before we started recording, about how
we kind of expected to have like a whole list of indie games, like short games,
and really the first thing that I thought of this is: I've just been playing
Destiny 2 all summer. So we're gonna talk about Destiny 2 for a little bit,
specifically about Forsaken, the DLC that came out a couple weeks ago, as well
as about kind of the pattern, that ebb and flow that Destiny 2 has gone through
this summer, because I think that it has, and I'm curious to see if you also
experienced this, where Destiny 2 when it came out seemed very much like it
would have a very long tail.

__Megan: [00:43:53]__ Like there is a lot to do. But then pretty quickly I
dropped off. I found myself just not playing as often, the things I can do to
level up usually required being in a group, and I wasn't. I didn't always have
a group, like often, but not always. So I found myself using Destiny 2, mostly
as a social crutch? Like to talk to friends that I didn't really talk to all
that often except when we're playing Destiny 2. So it became less of a game,
and more of a social event for me.

__Megan: [00:44:23]__ And then Forsaken dropped, and I'm totally back in, I
have so many things that I want to do in Forsaken, I have this ridiculous quest
to go after Malfeasance, which is one of the new exotic guns, and I'm
definitely seeing again the same thing I said this last September, which is
that I think this is going to have a long tail. And, you know, maybe it
actually will, maybe this is just the pattern that Destiny is going to go
through.

__Megan: [00:44:53]__ So how about you? Did you also experience that? Were you—
Was it a lull and then you kind of came back with a vengeance?

__Saf: [00:45:01]__ So I haven't actually taken any huge breaks from Destiny. I
guess consciously, I took some breaks when I was like, uh, busy with other
stuff and didn't actually have time for Destiny, or didn't let myself play it
because I knew I'd play too much. But Destiny... I've kind of fall into a
pattern of like it's just — at least before the new expansion came out — I
would just run around and shoot stuff and do, I don't know, collect stuff and
try and grind up my character just to like do something to relax, because that
sounds relaxing. It is actually really relaxing for me though, because I really
enjoy how Bungie does gameplay. They've just really perfected game feel and I
really appreciate that.

__Megan: [00:45:44]__ They are great at that satisfaction mood thing. Not sure
if there's a term for it.

__Saf: [00:45:49]__ Yeah, something like that feel. I don't know. There is a
word for that. I know what you mean. Bungie's soooo good at that, and I just, I
don't know, I just keep going back to it. I haven't yet taken any huge breaks.
I haven't been bored by the game, even though... people weren't wrong when they
were saying there wasn't much in-game content, but once Warmind came out, and
then the ramp up to Forsaken, I've discovered that there is a lot that I wanted
to do, considering. I decided I was going to {inaudible} armor, which was a lot
of just needing to play to get that armor.

__Megan: [00:46:21]__ Yes, I got to the blue set. I did not get to the purple
set, but I did finish them. Or, like, I got the blue set. So yeah that was fun.
That was definitely a good— that was during my 'Destiny as social space'
period, so that gave us a lot to do and that was nice. And of course with
Forsaken there's a ton to do. I don't — have you — you haven't quite finished
the campaign yet, right?

__Saf: [00:46:47]__ I finished the campaign but I have it done like everything
that you can do storywise, I guess. There's the whole Dreaming City thing that
you can unlock after the campaign is finished. But technically the campaign is
finished, but I haven't fully finished, basically. I got the achievement and
the Triumph, like "you finished the campaign" and I was like "cool!" and it was
like "actually go do this thing" and I'm like "okay" because it gives me more
to do. So I finished the story of it at least. But I have, I don't know, that
next little bit to finish off and I was going to finish the campaign right
after I came out, but then I got very distracted by the new bounty system.

__Megan: [00:47:23]__ So technically I have access to the Dreaming City and I
thought that I would love it because it had some lore stuff that I adore.
Forsaken had some moments first, like at camp we were actually singing songs
greenly like lore stuff that I've been into for 3–4 years.

__Megan: [00:47:47]__ So that was all great, but then when I got to the end
game I found myself ignoring that Dreaming City stuff and just playing Gambit
for seventeen hours.

__Saf: [00:47:58]__ Oh you've played so much game. I am so impressed.

__Megan: [00:48:01]__ It's because — it's actually PvP for people who don't
like PvP it's like waves of enemies and you're playing with real people but you
don't have to worry about them until the invader section, and it just works
really well for me. And I love like the new character that comes with it, I
love the weapons you can get from it. So just having a great time but I really
need to stop this Gambit addiction and do other actual in-game stuff that I'm
supposed to be writing about, because I'm supposed to be writing about 17 hours
of Gambit.

__Saf: [00:48:42]__ They should let you write about 17 hours of Gambit, because
I would read that, because I've only played one round of Gambit so far. My team
did win, even though I didn't know what I was doing, and I accidently screwed
up a whole bunch. So now my team still won. I was being carried along I think.

__Megan: [00:48:55]__ It's very confusing in the beginning, I definitely had my
moments of "where's the bank, what do I do." Part of what I like so much about
Gambit is that you can see what the other team is doing. You can see their
progress, so it's almost feels like being psychic and being able to see what's
going on, on the other side. You know, you can't actually see the other team,
but you can really strategize according to what they're doing, and I really
like that sense of having a top view of a battlefield, and then also being on
the ground at the same time just fighting waves of enemies.

__Saf: [00:49:33]__ Not gonna lie, I didn't realize you could see what the
other team was doing! Is that like in the little bars at the top? Does they
tell you at the top there?

__Megan: [00:49:39]__ Yes.

__Saf: [00:49:39]__ Okay. See, I did not understand what any that was. No, I
did get like a lot {inaudible} and I was like "hehehe, have fun with this,
team!"

__Megan: [00:49:49]__ Yes. Yeah. And you'll get it. I think it's really neat
how they did the UI to show you what stage the other team's at. Definitely
takes some getting used to.

__Saf: [00:50:01]__ Yeah. It's a very different way of playing, but it's really
cool.

__Megan: [00:50:08]__ And I think it's very unique. It's a game type that not
only Bungie hasn't done before, but as far as I know, there hasn't been
anything quite like it, ever.

__Saf: [00:50:16]__ Yeah, I can't think of any competitive game stuff that does
something like that. It's a really good way of introducing PvP without it being
like "Crucible! Fight other people, other live humans who know what they're
doing." It's like, you are competing. And also a little bit there at the start,
you can see the other team. It's very good.

__Megan: [00:50:42]__ There's a fun little moment where you're in the lobby,
and I do think I guess it's kind of a loading screen, but it's also decent
opportunity to see: "Yeah there are other people on the other side" and have
the standoff emoji. So, yeah, it's a good time.

__Megan: [00:51:01]__ Oddly enough, I've completely transformed as a person,
because instead of playing a single player game, I'm just obsessively playing
Gambit. But the single player game that I probably should or could be
experiencing is Spiderman the new... I think it's technically called
**[Marvel's Spider-Man]**, which I have only played the first mission of, and
was very good.

__Megan: [00:51:29]__ Disclaimer is that I have a friend who worked on it, so I
had to buy it to like, support her. She interned with the studio and was like
telling me about how it was, and it was really exciting for her. So I wanted to
pick it up, but I was also really glad that it got good reviews. People have
said it's so much fun, and I do really like it.

__Megan: [00:51:49]__ I'm kind of carefully strategizing right now because I'm
on the PS4 but I play most games on the Xbox, so I like to remember the
controls, and there are a lot of combos in Spiderman. Seems like I'm going to
have to remember 8 different combos, and then go to a completely different
console, and play Gambit for 2 weeks, and then come back, and I'll have
forgotten everything about Spiderman. Right now I'm kind of strategizing like
"okay I'm going to just finish this for a while, and that I'll go back." So
I've put aside Spiderman for now, but what I have seen so far has been really
fun. The combat's great, the script is really fun. Everybody's talking about
when he tell us, like the social media feeds... It seems just really polished.
The idea of a superhero game didn't necessarily appeal to me, as that wasn't
itself a draw, but I'm glad that I got it, I'm looking forward to playing more.

__Saf: [00:52:45]__ Yeah, I'm excited to see it getting such good reviews.
People really seem to be loving it. I probably won't play it, mostly because I
barely touch my PS4 these days, and I'm also so deep in Destiny, I don't think
I could pull myself away to play another AAA game, because I don't want to
spend that time not playing Destiny. It's a problem. Destiny has become a
problem for me.

__Megan: [00:53:07]__ I'm glad you joined us in the Destiny pit.

__Saf: [00:53:10]__ It has absolutely happened. I've just gone so deep in
there. I'm going to do _everything_, I'm gonna do the clan stuff, I'm gonna do
nightfalls, and I've been doing everything and it was a lot of stuff.

__Saf: [00:53:20]__ But Spider Man looks really cool. If I get the chance to
play it, I really want to, because, like you said, it's really polished and I
love a good polished game.

__Megan: [00:53:28]__ That's about all that I've been playing recently. That we
did. I want to talk about E3 a little bit. We had discussed adding an episode
after E3 and it just never happened. I have been around the game announcements
since. And that was where Forsaken wa announced.

__Saf: [00:53:44]__ Oh yeah, that's right! I forgot about that. So long ago.

__Megan: [00:53:48]__ Sounds like another world now. Well, Forsaken itself was
not the first trailer, and **[Andal and Cayde]**'s stuff was announced there.
So the only thing that I wanted to make sure to point out while we're here with
our limited amount of time, and because we need to stay on brand, is **[Halo
Infinite]** which was announced, and we know pretty much nothing else about it.
I have a lot of theories about what's going on, about what it's gonna cover,
and what kinda game it's gonna be, but with no real solid answer. We just know
so far that it looks like a very pretty, possibly open world, Master Chief
game. So that's cool. I don't really have too much to say about it except that
— it's Western Regions. We couldn't _not_ talk about it.

__Saf: [00:54:33]__ Exactly. I am tentatively very excited, because Halo 5
continually disappoints me whenever I think about it. Which makes me really sad
to say, because I've replaying through Halo again with someone else this time,
because I keep referencing it. Well, I keep making Halo references and now
they're playing with me so they can understand what I'm talking about. And then
we hit Halo 4, and like 4 is so well written. Halo 4 is an amazing game. And I
think about 5 and I'm like "oh no, do we have to. I don't want to." So I want
another Master Chief game. And I'm glad there is going to be a Master Chief
game. And I'm also extremely excited for the fact it's gonna be a new engine,
and they're going to do new stuff through it; I'm really keen to see what they
do. But I'm also like "please, please write a good game."

__Megan: [00:55:18]__ My relationship to Halo has changed a little bit, and I'm
not sure I know what I want from it anymore, which also makes speculating
difficult, because I'm not as invested as I used to be. But, at the same time,
Halo is one of those things that I've kind of always come back to. So I'm
looking forward to seeing what this is going to be about.

__Megan: [00:55:45]__ It's tough because it is going to compete with Destiny,
it's gonna compete with a lot of games that are designed to be long term
experiences and I'll be kinda curious to see whether it finds a place in my
schedule as a long term experience the way Halo games have in the past.

__Saf: [00:56:08]__ Yeah. Yeah. It'll be interesting to see. I guess we'll get
it eventually because they didn't show much at E3, but I'm glad that they
finally announced it was happening, because there was no news about Halo 6 for
a while, and I was like "is this actually going to happen? What's going on?"
But it's happening and that's very exciting.

__Megan: [00:56:29]__ Actually, what do you think about the fact that it's not
called Halo 6? Do you think that that means that they might go away from some
of the choices they made in 5? Do you think that it doesn't mean that at all,
any idea about the fact that they just, they're not branding it as part of the
forerunner trilogy, which was kind of a big thing and then it... wasn't
anymore.

__Saf: [00:56:51]__ Yeah I have no clue. I imagine it will still stick to a lot
of the same stuff, like the Forerunners and the AI stuff, because they've been
building up a lot of that stuff in the novels as well. I have a lot of theories
they're basically based off what they have actually been focusing on in novels.
These things. So they're possibly going to try and bring that more into the
next game. But it's all theorising. I do find it interesting that they did
choose not to give it a number though, because I feel like it means that even
if it does continue the story of the previous two games, it's still gonna do
something different to try and move away from that, potentially. I have no
clue, honestly. Like you, all I have is speculation and theories, which are
based on, y'know, literally nothing, because there's nothing about the game
out.

__Megan: [00:57:39]__ Yeah, we'll see. It's hard to speculate at this point.

__Saf: [00:57:42]__ But speaking of Halo, I have been playing Halo, but I've
also finally picked up **[ODST]**... And then I promptly put it back down
again. It turns out: don't like the game. I remember trying to play it ages ago
and being like "Eh, I'm not playing {inaudible}, what's the point." And
basically I had the exact same reaction this time, but also I now have an
active dislike of Buck which means I've gone into this with already having a
dislike of Buck. So as soon as Buck was on screen I was like "Ugh it's Buck and
Nathan Fillion, I don't want this." Like, no shade on Nathan Fillion, I love
Cayde, just turns out when a villain looks like Nathan Fillion in a game, it's
very jarring and I don't like that. Because my brain's like "it's Nathan
Fillion, Nathan Fillion's here, Nathan Fillion's talking, Nathan Fillion" and I
can't be like "yes this is the character Buck. It's just Nathan Fillion.".

__Saf: [00:58:31]__ And that's been a big thing with me. It's why I couldn't
read the book about Buck. It's the reason I struggled with Halo 5 so much.
Turns out I struggled with ODST with it, but also: ODST is just not a great
game. It has a really big hype around it, and I think it's because when it came
out it was quite different. It was a new thing. It was interesting. But playing
it now, after all the other games I play that are Bungie games, and the rest of
the Halo games I just think the writing's not great, the design of the game
isn't great, and it's just a little bit frustrating to play. So yeah, I've
ended up putting it down. Cause turns out, I don't care enough to finish the
game.

__Megan: [00:59:18]__ I'm actually glad that you're joining me as a Halo
heretic that doesn't love ODST.

__Saf: [00:59:22]__ Ah, I'm so very glad. I'm with you, very much.

__Megan: [00:59:25]__ Yeah, I feel very much the same way. I didn't get that
sense of... I mean I think it's pretty, er, I feel goofy saying it but I think
the big appeal of Halo is that kind of power fantasy of being a SPARTAN, and
when you didn't have that it just felt like slog. Also I think given the order
that I played the games in, I didn't get that experience that you had, or
rather than you said some people had, I think that was a really good
observation that people liked it as something different. Whereas the way the
order in which I experienced the games in didn't quite have that. So I agree
with you. That's my Halo heresy.

__Saf: [01:00:04]__ Yeah. Halo is military sci-fi. And a lot of the military
camaraderie kind of thing is, y'know, quite played out, because that's part of
what makes Halo. But I feel like ODST kinda goes a little too far in that and
the characters are really unlikable because they're kinda making fun of each
other all the time, they just don't really meld, it doesn't feel like they're
doing as a squad, it just feels like they all hate each other. It makes it
really hard to believe they are a team.

__Saf: [01:00:28]__ And also: they're ODSTs. So they're like: "we're not
leaving without this man." And I'm like, "well, you kind _do_ that though.
That's like what you're meant to do. You just go in there, head in like you
expect, like each other to die." Sacrificing all of yourselves to save to pull
out someone's buddy definitely goes against the whole ODST thing. I don't know.
I amm biased against ODSTs because of Buck, which is really annoying cause
ODSTs are really cool.

__Megan: [01:00:55]__ Yeah, the true Spartan loyalty is... I agree with it.

__Saf: [01:00:59]__ And also the whole previous romance thing with Buck and
what's-her-name was just — the moment they start doing that I'm just like "oh
my god, are you actually kidding me." Like this is just very tropey, very
poorly written. It's just not great. No offense to anybody that loves that
game, because I'm sure you have good reasons to. But it's the one Halo game,
well, that's a lie, I haven't played the Halo Wars games, but that's cause I'm
bad at strategy, but it's like the one console Halo game I've just not been
able to finish. And I've finished Halo 1 multiple times.

__Megan: [01:01:32]__ Yeah I'm with you there.

__Saf: [01:01:36]__ Yeah it was kind of sad. Yeah that, that happened.

__Saf: [01:01:39]__ I've also picked up a bit of **[Sea of Thieves]** which
was, y'know, the pirate game that came out a while back, which is really fun.
It's really really fun. I kind of have been playing it with my partner, so it's
been more of like a chill kind of social thing, I'm kind of been treating it in
a similar way that I treat Destiny. Just doing what I want, not really caring
about the story or anything. Well, I do care, but y'know, like this kind of
thing is social thing.

__Saf: [01:02:06]__ So just kind of sailing around and I run around after pigs
because they're really cute and I feed them bananas because pigs are really
cute. That kind of thing. I just find my own ways to enjoy the game. And it is
gorgeous. The ocean animation, and the sky, and just everything is amazingly
gorgeous. The color palettes are really good. It is a very pretty game. And I
think like if you're playing it singleplayer, it's not super exciting, but
playing it with other people as a team thing or just a social thing is really
cool, cause it's kind of a cool space to hang out in. So I really like that.
I'm not going to sink a million hours into it, but I enjoy it enough that if
someone asks me if I can help them with a quest, I'll be like "yes, I'll join
you." I'll come up aboard and help you sail your ship and look at the water a
whole bunch. Yeah, it's a cool game.

__Megan: [01:02:55]__ Good! Yeah I've heard good things about it. That's one,
that's always online right? That's the other thing I've heard about it. If I'm
thinking of the right pirate game, is that there's been a lot of griefing,
where people take the chance to just kind of mess with players. Am I thinking
of the right thing?

__Saf: [01:03:12]__ It's kind of built for that, though, because it is a pirate
game. So you can form alliances, but also you can find people that are just
terrible. There was one point I was playing with my partner and they were like,
they were like, "Do you want to blow up that ship and take their loot" and I
was like "yeah! Okay." And then the ship came closer and the person was like
"Hey! How's it going?" And I was like "oh no, I don't want to." But by that
point it was too late casue we'd already set the gunpowder barrels. So we blew
up this ship. And I felt really bad.

__Saf: [01:03:41]__ And both me and the other person died. So we're... Like
there's a ghost ship you go to you when you die, like you're on your way to
respawn, and they just sit there like pointing at me with the pointing emote.
And I was just like, using the quick chat, like going "Sorry, sorry, I'm
sorry." And they were just shaking their head going "No." Just pointing at me,
you know, and I'm like "I'm so sorry. Oh my god, I can't believe I've done
this."

__Saf: [01:04:02]__ So it is somewhat of an expected thing that you will get
into fights with people. Basically you have to treat like actual pirates. So
sometimes you can form alliances and people will be nice, but sometimes you
will find people who just want to destroy your ship. And so you've kinda got to
play it... Luckily they're not like a ship that you build up over ages, and
that you care about heaps. They're kind of disposable. A lot of stuff is quite
disposable. You don't lose your items or anything when you die. So it is always
like PvP, it is always online, or PvE I guess. But it creates an interesting
dynamic with the game, which I find really interesting seeing how people deal
with that. But yeah, if you want to go to a game and not get attacked by people
ever... it's not a good game for you.

__Megan: [01:04:50]__ No, that sounds like fun, if you go in expecting that.

__Saf: [01:04:53]__ Yeah exactly. And I think a lot of online games don't
really teach you to expect that, so much.
