<p>A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me <em>not</em> to write a Star Wars
× Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
potential the crossover’s universe has… many stories could have been written
within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers’
imagination. Rated T. {135k words}</p>

<p>Rated T but should have been M. Probably. This is Dune, but in the Star Wars
universe, with more sex and less Bene Gesserit. It does a good job of showing
the horror of the amount of lives lost during space conflict, when billions
of lives cry out in the Force, and it has an actual effect on those
sensitive. In the original six, there is a whole three minutes spent on the
destruction of a planet and millions of souls; two Jedi briefly look up and
say, almost deadpan, that they felt two billion souls die… and then they go
back to what they were doing, barely affected. In TFA, Starkiller Base
destroys five planets — there are no estimates I could find on the population
of the system, but let’s put it in the high dozen billions, maybe even half a
trillion — and there is even less effect on the Force-sensitive. Like, come
on! Billions have just died. At least show the Force-touched having a
<em>little</em> emotion here, maybe. So, in The Last Jedi, our protagonist Tobin, as
a youngling, witnesses the killing of “merely” thousands and feels it in the
Force, and it disturbs him so greatly that he has to isolate himself and cry
for hours at a time. A trained Jedi Knight is shown as losing control of her
emotions in violent manner. Even a less-monstrously-sensitive Mirakula is
strained and isolates herself, even while she has lived through dozens or
hundreds of such events already and could be thought to be inured against the
horror. Anyway, as you may see, I liked this fic a lot. {185k words}</p>

<p>Good story. The plots are thought-out and I really appreciate the insight
into other characters. The entire Chamber of Secrets episode, in particular,
is as much about Ginny and her struggle against Tom, than it is about Harry
and Sirius and friends… and then after that, the experience didn’t just
completely not matter, there are credible post-trauma effects, and the people
around don’t just forget what they’ve been through either. Last volume is
unfinished at time of writing, but updated recently. I’m hoping for a
Harry/Ginny ship but not holding my breath: there’s a lot of potential still.

<p>Oh, that was beautifully done. It is really a work you have to read to
experience. A summary would not do it justice. A description could not hope
to cover its walks and turns. This is what people mean when they say you have
edit down such that only what is needed remains. It all comes together in its
final chapter, triggering understanding over all the previous ones, but still
leaving us with that uncertainty Hermione hinted to at the Grimmauld party:
that you cannot really be sure it was all his work, or not. {90k words}</p>

<p>Ongoing. By <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence">the same author</a> as Honour Thy Blood, and reusing the
original personalities and names of its supporting cast, which is an amazing
idea as I get to rediscover and appreciate them anew, in a much better
environment and not just in flashbacks, as paintings, or in history scenes.
Yes, this is a time travel fic. I like the way it’s written, and although
it’s not perfectly beta’d (there’s homophones and awkward phrasings) it’s
much better than HTB at that. Followed and looking forward to new chapters.

<p>It’s adult, it’s sweet, it’s funny, it’s lively. Not lively as in it’s joyful

You know that quote about how grown-up fiction is about english professors
wondering about who to fuck, and YA fiction is about overthrowing the
government and picking up the pieces? This is grown-up YA fiction. The
government has been overthrown, the villains have been defeated, and there’s
still the shit attitudes in society that caused it all in the first place —
but we’re working on that. There’s peace. But it’s the picking up of pieces
that remains to be done. Recovering from all you’ve lived, and figuring out
where you’re going. Treating all the fucked up stuff you’ve done and that’s
still in your head. Talking to people. Getting angry and pissed off and
breaking up and making up and it all not being the literal end of the world.
Living life. And slowly getting there. {137k words}</p>
