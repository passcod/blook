<p>There’s been two chapters of <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/tourist/">Tourist</a> this period, so naturally I’ve commented
with my impressions on both: <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2016/12/23/tourist-five/#comment-415">[1]</a>, <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2017/01/07/tourist-six/#comment-423">[2]</a>. <strong>Tourist</strong>
is <a href="https://twitter.com/Wanderlustin">Saf</a>’s current serial novel about AI and asexuality and depression and it’s
great! Not only do I love her writing, I love the themes and the way she
explores them. There’s a few scenes which evoke a very particular feeling I’ve
experienced, and it’s fascinating that Saf is able to make me remember how that
feeling is like just through her words. The writing was perhaps a little
hesitant at first, but it’s been getting better and better every chapter. The
latest chapter is excellent.</p>

<p>Pretty good. I liked the modern take. A bit <em>too</em> prodigious perhaps, but
that’s what the title announced so who’s complaining? Waaay crazy story. Do
not read in more than one sitting, because there is SO MUCH SHIT HAPPENING

<p>Great story, good writing. Unsure how accurate the Japanese/Yakuza details
are (but it’s gotta be better than Rowling’s own attempts at representing
asian <del>stereotypes</del> characters), and the large amount of Japanese words and
phrases embedded in the text make it somewhat tougher to read than usual.

<p>Despite claiming, as is usual, that all belongs to Rowling, this fic really
only uses the characters and some general elements of plot. The universe is
one of the most original I have ever read. It is an utterly different world,
and extremely well built and detailed. Not content to be defined over a few
departure points, it is rich of several dozen centuries of history with a
particular focus, due to the story, around Europe, the British Isles, and the
Americas. But this world is dark and cruel and bleak, and that itself is a
terrible understatement. Content warnings for sexual and otherwise abuse,
exploitation, horror… and yet that feels like too little said. It is a very
good work. It surpasses many original, published, novels I have read in the
genre. But while it hooked me and wouldn’t let me go as I devoured it, each
further installment shook me deeper. Even with an active imagination and few
of the ‘moral’ blockers on thought most my peers have, this world and its
inhabitants shocked me in their depravity and casual evil, but most
importantly, in the way it showed every single cause and character as
believing they were in the right, even while performing and perpetuating
wickedness, resulting in institutionalised malevolence in every situation and
at every level of society. Even the heroes, the protagonists, the good ones,
those trying to quite literally save the world from itself, are merely
<em>questionably good</em> most of the time. It is a dark, dark work, but it is
very, very good. It’ll haunt me for a while. If you at all can, <strong>read it.</strong>

<p>Interesting format, with distinct arcs corresponding to Naruto’s missions
instead of a single continuity of plot. It makes the whole thing more
approachable, and sets clear expectations around the progression of a
particular writing stint. Unfinished, but not abandoned; there are long-term
plot lines still in suspens (and I’m not talking about the canon plot lurking
in the background, rather about the original plot lines that make it all
interesting). {370k words at time of writing}</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yet another marriage contract story. What can I say? I like
romance, and this is one of the most popular and least sappy romance genre in
this fandom. I found the basis for the story interesting, and the resolution
swift if perhaps a bit anti-climatic. But then again, the defeat of Voldemort
was never the focus of the plot. The fic brushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813949273528102912">some thoughts</a>
I had while reading, namely on the influence Harry’s near worship for a
decade, without having a real person to mellow it, would have had on society,
particularly regarding standards of appearance and, to a lesser extent,
behaviour. There was a strange consistent corruption to the spelling of some
words, almost as if the text had been OCR’d: notably, various ‘I’ or ‘i’
letters had been replaced with ‘1’, but not all of them. {165k words}</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern">Jbern</a> rarely disappoints. This was a fun story, but not a Humour story.
Typical plot of Individual!Harry going against Dumbledore, but various
atypical plot elements, mostly around making typically-always-good characters
have questionable morals and make less-than-Light decisions, and making
typically-always-evil characters be borderline good but forced in a bad
situation. It adds an interesting realism. Few bad points, but one in
particular (rot13): va gung lrf, gurer vf n cybg-rkphfr sbe ebznapr gb tb

reasoning in dialogue, it changes from both naïve or
overcomplex-in-hopes-of-sounding-smart plans and narration simply omitting
planning and showing only the results. Including planning that actually feels
intelligent is a great addition to any story. {340k words}</p>

<p>This was really really good. I love Hermione time travel stories. I love when
all the characters have their own flame, their own passions and thoughts and
reasons and defects. I also really love stories that were planned out before
they were written, and written before they were published, as they are
invariably of better quality, simply due to having been revised and
cross-written. Contains graphic sex, but gentle and hot and furious and
<em>real</em>. Some scenes reminded me of sex I’ve had, see, that’s how good and
real it was. Also contains instances of graphic violence, but not gore, and
not deeply disturbing. It covers war (both of them) and terror and torture,
but it’s not meant to shock and disgust. If you read nothing else on this
list, I do recommend this one. {555k words}</p>

<p>This list is getting way too long, but fortunately we’re two days before this
update goes out and the next few fics I have queued are crackfics or
small-length fics, so they should all make it into the short format list
below. Well-written, and with a delightful amount of lesbian, gay, and bi
characters, all presented positively, little prejudice in this regard all
around. Also remarkably good with letting everyone be happy with their
various religions, while calling out cultural misappropriation. No trans or
enbies that I could find, but we’re getting there. Happy-ending fic,
even more so than the other happy-ending fics I’ve read recently; this is
positively Disney-esque in its epilogue. Although it’s certainly <em>not</em>
Disney-esque in its contents, with sex à gogo, lots of innuendo, etc. There’s
also violence and abuse present, this isn’t an all-rainbows fest. One
persistent bad point: the cavalier way horrific fates are dished onto some
antagonists. Sure, it might seem like karmic retribution, but cheerfully
finishing off Malfoy by having him be taken by <em>human traffickers intent on
forcing him into prostitution</em> still leaves a bad taste in. {520k words}</p>
