Let me fall  
so we can fly  
so we can glide  
over the clouds.

Let me fall  
so we can fly  
so we can float  
over the sky.

Let me fall  
so we can fly  
past anything  
you’ve ever seen.

Let me fall  
so we can fly  
so we can laugh  
so we can cry.

Let me fall…

One day I was walking under the rain.  
Thinking thoughts that shouldn’t be.  
There’s no point, that’s no life, let’s.  
Just. Fall. Here. Alone. Yet. Alive.

I am the king of my own place.  
The master of my castle.  
I have the right of life and death.  
Over its very walls and floors.

You  
picked me up you  
held me close you  
pressed me against you.

So let me fall  
so we can be  
so we can breath  
so we can feel the other close.

Let me fall  
so we can live  
so we can die  
so we can build up our home.

Let me fall  
so we can talk  
so we can yell  
so we can fight about nothing.

Let me fall  
so we can fly  
so we can smile  
so we can feel the wind go past.

Oh, let me fall  
into your arms.
