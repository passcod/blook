## Donations

Every year that I am able to, I try to give a sizeable portion of my salary
away in donations to various organisations and charities I believe make the
world a better place. This year, I chose to give 5% of my gross salary, i.e.
$2750, to over 15 organisations and individuals.

All amounts are in NZ dollars, even if the donation was in another currency.
