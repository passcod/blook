Darkness

Darkness all around and  
light but not light; red  
orange dark but less dark  
than darkness.

Lines of darkness dancing  
across. Deformed shapes of  
fire running in circles.

Black dark black light all  
around; red orange brights.

Everything fades.

Feeling eternally sleepy yet  
curious at the lack of heat I  
open my eyes to see a cloud  
has obscured the sun's rays  
through leaves and branches.

Summer breeze, lack of sun...  
I get up.
