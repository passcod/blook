So the other day after tweeting [a][t1] [few][t2] [#NBRightsNow][t3]
[words][t4] mostly because [Alice] started retweeting good ones, I went ahead
and researched statistics regarding non-binary people. Unsurprisingly, the
information is pretty scarce. I searched far and wide and found only two
sources that had actual numbers and analysis instead of hand-waving:

## UK Census 2011

Don't get your hopes up. [This census][census] didn't include a "non-binary"
gender box. In fact, the UK census office has been [pretty clear][petition1] in
that [they will *not*][petition2] make [that][elancane] a reality any time
soon. Fuckers. (However, [that census might get scraped][beyond] altogether, so
it may be that there will *never __ever__* be a NB-friendly census in the UK.)

However, they did record how many people either filled in both F and M boxes,
or filled none, or wrote something else in the space instead. While I find that
*quite* flimsy as a measure of non-binarism, it's better than nothing.

[Practical Androgyny][pa] makes [an in-depth analysis][analysis] of the
question, and finds a 0.5% figure of non-binaries. That figure is, of course,
to take as *highly* under-reported.

## New Zealand 

A more reliable statistic comes from a [study][uoa] by the University of
Auckland. It shows a much higher figure: 2.5% of "not sure" and 1% of
"transgender" in a representative sample.

Identification is tricky. Will a trans identify as NB? Are all NB trans? Does
trans mean "not cis" or does it mean "someone previously identified as one
gender and who now identifies as another"? Are those two different? How many of
those who are "not sure" are actually cis, how many are NB? How many
respondents answered incorrectly for a laugh?

(Actually, ignore that last one as a good study usually has checks in place to
prevent these things from skewing the results.)

## Comparisonics

So let's say that the proportion of non-binaries is between 0.5% and 3.5%. Say
2%. I then searched for some statistic that would give it more punch. Raw
numbers aren't very useful. Humans have [difficulty visualising][dust-specks]
very [small or large numbers][circular]. Comparisons are better understood on a
fundamental level, and may pack more emotional power, if chosen carefully.

I had some trouble with that. You see, I kept trying to go for the mundane (you
are, of course, more likely to by an enby than to win the lottery, but also
more likely than to die in a car accident), or for the bizarre (you're less
likely than to not be anyone's best friend, but more likely than to be a twin,
triplet, or quadruplet).

A better comparison is that being NB is *as* or *more* likely than to be gay.

Now tell me again how non-binary people are statistical errors.
