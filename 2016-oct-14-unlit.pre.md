“You shouldn't be driving.”  
“I haven't had a drink.”  
“You know what I mean.”  
“Yeah.”

I drove on, Sani besides me.  
Stopped at the lights, fumbled with my phone, trying to put music on.  
Light turns green.  
Grip the wheel with one hand, shut the phone with the other, make an awkward run into the avenue.  
No cars around still, but more homes and driveways.

I turn into my lane, streetlight shining down

on me  
and the empty  
passenger seat.
