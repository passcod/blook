## Writing

I've spent a lot of my weekends writing a Star Wars fanfic. I'm going to finish
it before I publish, to avoid publishing and then abandoning it when I
eventually realise I've written myself into a corner. It's completely outlined,
and I've got some willing and eager proofreaders waiting for it, so I have
hope.

I've already got ideas for a sequel; if there's interest I might be
working on that for a while, too. The sequel will contain [a certain ship].

No title as of yet, working title of my file is SW:E:SI, but what it stands for
was already outdated by the time I got to the middle of the outlining, so it
will be changing.

## 300 Shorts

I've moved my "300 Shorts" collection entirely to this blog, instead of its
previous home on Medium. I've also added [an introductory post], which
additionally serves as a common 'parent post' for all the shorts, taking
advantage of my blog engine's capabilities: it will add a link from each entry
to the main post, and add a list (with links) of all the entries onto that main
post.

I've also published two so-far-unpublished pieces from 2016 into this collection.
The first is a short poem written last year: [Unlit]. The second is a sci-fi
story originally written for a contest: [Regulus]. It is accompanied by a few
pages of [notes and commentary].

## Tourist

Chapter Seven [made me really happy][tourist-7] and I felt more bubbly than
usual writing its comment. Perhaps it was the ice-cream.

## Backup and Sync

Discovered a very interesting paper, algorithm, and software: [MetaSync]. It
provides a sync utility that can store data across several services and even
replicate this data for maximum reliability and synchronisation speed. I have
yet to evaluate the solution in-depth for my needs, but it certainly sounds
promising.

Ultimately, though, the software is not quite as maintained nor modern as I
would wish it. For this reason, my next large Rust project will be to implement
the pPaxos algorithm, the core metasync library, a CLI frontend and a sync
Daemon, as well as some remote storage adapters (probably starting with
Dropbox, Google Drive, MEGASync), and some local storage middleware (selective
encryption, compression).

I'll probably choose a different name, though, not only to avoid stepping on
toes, but also because I don't quite believe "meta sync" to be a good
descriptor for what this does.

## Fanfiction

All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I explored the Harry Potter fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.
Contains occasional lemons. Fairly large proportion of Haphne.

- {HP/SW Legends} [The Katarn Side](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side).

  A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
  material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
  Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me _not_ to write a Star Wars
  × Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
  Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
  interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
  remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
  potential the crossover's universe has… many stories could have been written
  within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers'
  imagination. Rated T. {135k words}

- {SW Legends} [The Last Jedi](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5704904/1/The-Last-Jedi).

  Rated T but should have been M. Probably. This is Dune, but in the Star Wars
  universe, with more sex and less Bene Gesserit. It does a good job of showing
  the horror of the amount of lives lost during space conflict, when billions
  of lives cry out in the Force, and it has an actual effect on those
  sensitive. In the original six, there is a whole three minutes spent on the
  destruction of a planet and millions of souls; two Jedi briefly look up and
  say, almost deadpan, that they felt two billion souls die… and then they go
  back to what they were doing, barely affected. In TFA, Starkiller Base
  destroys five planets — there are no estimates I could find on the population
  of the system, but let's put it in the high dozen billions, maybe even half a
  trillion — and there is even less effect on the Force-sensitive. Like, come
  on! Billions have just died. At least show the Force-touched having a
  _little_ emotion here, maybe. So, in The Last Jedi, our protagonist Tobin, as
  a youngling, witnesses the killing of "merely" thousands and feels it in the
  Force, and it disturbs him so greatly that he has to isolate himself and cry
  for hours at a time. A trained Jedi Knight is shown as losing control of her
  emotions in violent manner. Even a less-monstrously-sensitive Mirakula is
  strained and isolates herself, even while she has lived through dozens or
  hundreds of such events already and could be thought to be inured against the
  horror. Anyway, as you may see, I liked this fic a lot. {185k words}

- {HP} [Innocent](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent), [Initiate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate), [Identity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity), [Impose](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11732213/1/Impose).

  Good story. The plots are thought-out and I really appreciate the insight
  into other characters. The entire Chamber of Secrets episode, in particular,
  is as much about Ginny and her struggle against Tom, than it is about Harry
  and Sirius and friends… and then after that, the experience didn't just
  completely not matter, there are credible post-trauma effects, and the people
  around don't just forget what they've been through either. Last volume is
  unfinished at time of writing, but updated recently. I'm hoping for a
  Harry/Ginny ship but not holding my breath: there's a lot of potential still.

- {HP} [Contractual Invalidation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation).

  Oh, that was beautifully done. It is really a work you have to read to
  experience. A summary would not do it justice. A description could not hope
  to cover its walks and turns. This is what people mean when they say you have
  edit down such that only what is needed remains. It all comes together in its
  final chapter, triggering understanding over all the previous ones, but still
  leaving us with that uncertainty Hermione hinted to at the Grimmauld party:
  that you cannot really be sure it was all his work, or not. {90k words}

- {HP} [Stepping Back](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back).

  Ongoing. By [the same author][tbr] as Honour Thy Blood, and reusing the
  original personalities and names of its supporting cast, which is an amazing
  idea as I get to rediscover and appreciate them anew, in a much better
  environment and not just in flashbacks, as paintings, or in history scenes.
  Yes, this is a time travel fic. I like the way it's written, and although
  it's not perfectly beta'd (there's homophones and awkward phrasings) it's
  much better than HTB at that. Followed and looking forward to new chapters.
