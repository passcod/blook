# Deprecated content

There are three categories of so-called deprecated content:

1. (Mostly technical) writing that's just very outdated
2. (Mostly personal) writing that I don't hold to anymore

Both of these are available here, with the disclaimer inherent in the description.
However:

3. Content I dislike so much or that is so irrelevant it's no longer published here

That still exists in the git history, though.
