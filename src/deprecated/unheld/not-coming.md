# This is not a coming out

> 11 October 2014

When I try to determine how I feel about my gender in words, I go to the
[Genderqueer] wikipedia page. The article itself has a list of five ways
someone who is genderqueer may identify; it also has a nice aside listing every
genderkind known to wikipedia, and it references this list of [Facebook
genders]. Generally speaking, I do not identify with *any* of these, including
the genderqueer, genderfluid, nonconforming, questioning, variant, neither,
male, female, or pangender kinds. The only label that possibly applies is
"other" but that's not helpful at all.

I have no gender-related dysphoria. I am physically male and totally
comfortable that way. Mostly, __I do not care about gender.__ *My* gender, I
mean. When I prod the 'gender' field in my brain's information table, I get a
`E_NULL_POINTER` error. If you want to use gendered or non-gendered pronouns of
any kind or shape to refer to me, please go right ahead. Similarly with
gendered grammars. The only pronoun I may take offense at, in English (and
other languages if equivalent but I don't know them) is "it", unless it's part
of a metaphor or something. There's just one rule, and it's not even
gender-related: make it consistent.

Otherwise it may be confusing.

Now stop reading my silly blog and [go support people] who actually need it!
