# November 2017

## Music

After a couple Spotify Discovers that didn't really turn up anything I liked, I
decided to start my annual "pick a playlist from all the stuff I listened to
this year" early. That involves listening to all 500 songs I saved throughout
the previous 10 months carefully enough to decide whether they make the cut or
nah (which took two weeks), and then going through the resulting set to carve a
*theme* that makes the mess a whole and remove the extra. I'm still going
through that part.

This year it's looking like a mix and weave around tunes of the fabulous [Norah
Jones], beautiful contemporary instrumental pieces by swedish composers [August
Wilhelmsson] and [Martin Gauffin], [Lorde]'s latest, and the enchanting and
engaged vocals of [Vienna Tang]. It'll probably reach slightly less than 200
tracks. As usual, I pick a name that is both a celestial reference and has
subtle personal significance. This year it's **[Atarau]**.

## Rogare

With hours to spare, I completed the final piece of Cogitare and preparation for
this year's NaNoWriMo IRC chat room. Rogare is old made new, a simple bot
framework to support our writers. The name generator is ready and faster than
ever, more than a hundred prompts and writing seeds are filed into Dicere ready
for consumption through website and `!prompt`.

And at the end of november I'll pack it back up, not completely hidden away, but
safe and secure and regularly tested so it'll be ready to be dusted off for next
year. Onwards!

## Deckhack

I was invited to the Deckhack community, a happy ronde of devs and subversors
who build [Better Tweetdeck] and other related projects.

## Rotonde

I briefly started a Rotonde client but it didn't go anywhere, mostly because all
my other priorities and projects reared up and yelled that I didn't have time.

## NaNoWriMo

The first ten days of [NaNoWriMo] have been going a lot better than I thought (I
reached 25k words on the 9th!) and it has been very nice to reconnect with the
NZ community. I'll probably drive down to Auckland in the second part of
November to take part in in-person events, too.
