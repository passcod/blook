## Birthday

I turned a quarter century, which... actually it sounded pretty cool in my head
and even aloud but now it just sounds **o l d**. I'm still the youngest at work,
somehow. Even counting the "intern". I can only assume that won't last.

I got myself a [reMarkable], of which I had high expectations, and it performs
even better than I thought. I've been wanting a tool like this basically since
forever, and I think it will fill a gap in my tooling that nothing I'd ever
tried really came close to.

From others, I got chocolate and alcohol and live Jazz, which was pretty good.

## Keyboard learning

I'm not practicing with a very high regularity, but I'm managing a few sessions
a week, which is progressing me at an okay pace. So far I've totalled about 8
hours of cumulative practice, which brought me to about two thirds of the
lowercase keyboard at good accuracy and speed.

My test with keyboards and layout variants is whether I can confidently enter my
passphrases into terminal prompts (which offer absolutely zero input feedback).
Once I can achieve that, generally, I can use the keyboard for everyday tasks
and will get better much faster thus. I'm obviously not there yet.
