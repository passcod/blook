## Writing

I decided to put the Dawnverse on hold for now. I've got several stories I want
to tell within it, but I pretty much burned myself off it. I'll return to it at
some point. One thing is particular is that it feels a lot more original than
fanfic at this point, and I want to explore that. But not now.

I started [a Time Loop Star Wars fic around the New Jedi Order massacre][fic].
It's simple and requires a lot less thought and I'm writing it as it comes with
somewhat fuzzy plans for storylines, and it's a lot of fun (as well as being a
lot of drama).

Depending on how long it runs, it might become my "medium-sized creative
project" for the year. The year is long still, though.
