# Mostly regular: 2017-2019

In December 2016 I decided to blog more, and the way I chose to achieve that was
to give general updates across everything I was doing on a regular basis. In
2017 I produced one such update every month, plus one at the end of the year.
However, this effort faltered as it went on, until I completely gave it up in
early 2020.

These monthly updates were, in a way, cheaper and more informal than writing
blog posts for projects, and more durable than tweets. Their contents are kind
of "micro updates" on software developing, planning, life updates, reading,
writing, other craft projects... all sorts.
