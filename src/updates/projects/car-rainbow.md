# Car Rainbow

> April 2019

## Pitch

Adorning my car with a line of rainbow.

The original idea was to add a decoration that would distract from the various scratches and DIY
repairs on my car. I started by calculating the length I’d need, then designing and ordering about
five metres of rainbow “bumper” stickers in 30cm lengths. Then I mocked up the shape of the line
with masking tape, and sat on it for a few days. In the end I went with a diagonal line rather than
horizontal. It needed lots of adjustments to _look_ straight from a distance, while dealing with the
reality of curved surfaces. Once I received the stickers, careful application took three afternoons.

## Outcome

Done!

## Future

I'm still thinking as to what, if anything, I'd want to do on the front/back of the car.
