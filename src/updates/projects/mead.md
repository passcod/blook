# Mead

> August 2018

## Pitch

A batch of honeymead.

Mead is a pretty simple recipe, really: take honey, add water, optionally add something to help
yeasting (I used pears), add six to twenty-four months of time. This batch followed a much earlier
attempt in 2014.

After 364 days... I reopened all bottles, tested taste and carbonation, and recombined/split the lot
over four batches, adding varying amounts of EC1118. I vented the bottles twice a day, then once a
day, for a week, and finally stored them back for another round.

## Outcome

I have lots of pretty good mead!

I also have no idea how alcoholic they are. Whoops?

6-years-later update (October 2024): still dunno how alcoholic. A delightful gold colour... I should start on drinking those...
