# Caretaker

> May 2020 to February 2021

## Pitch

A “addon” contribution system for open software projects that trades higher trust for less effort
on the maintainers parts, allowing projects to survive and grow even if the creator is mostly
checked out.

## Outcome

Revised down from a fully fleshed-out system to a one-page description of the caretaker process,
which can be included in a project as-is.

Its mechanism has never been activated, to date. I didn't really anticipate anything else: in the
end this is more an "insurance" document in case I burn out or lose interest in open source again.
