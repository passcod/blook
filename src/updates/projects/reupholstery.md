# Reupholstering chairs

> April to July 2019

## Pitch

Putting some new fabric on the seat cushions.

I bought six chairs for pretty cheap, mostly because they're dirty and uncleanable. But the chairs
themselves are okay, if not very good quality (probably made from recycled wood originally). So I'm
going to reupholster them.

I sit on them, they're good.
