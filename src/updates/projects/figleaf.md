# Figleaf

> November 2019 to November 2020

## Pitch

“Crackfic-taken-seriously in the form of an open software project readme,” the configuration library.

It started as a redesign of `config-rs`. Then I started adding stuff. Then I abandoned all pretense
of this being at all realistic and started just going wild. Then I figured I might as well make
document it all so thoroughly and consistently it could actually plausibly have an implementation.

That's where I'm at. When done I'll see if I can put it up on AO3 somehow.
