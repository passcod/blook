# Zarc

> Early 2024

## Pitch

Experimentation in making a new archive file format with inline compression, integrity, and indexing.

## Outcome

Code here: <https://github.com/passcod/zarc>

Unlikely to finish; I got it to a point where IÂ could read/write archives and
implemented the core key features. It was a great learning project but
transforming it into a finished product is not on my roadmap.
