## Pitch

A simple certificate tool.

Mostly just binding to OpenSSL and creating/inspecting certificates with the least user interaction
possible. There are other tools that take a similar approach but they either do too little (only
self-signed certs, no self-CA-signed ones) or too much (install themselves by default into various
system certificate stores). Plus it was an interesting way to learn more about the OpenSSL APIs and
certificates.

## Outcome

Done: <https://github.com/passcod/certainly>

Deprecated. One should use the largely superior [step](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/) tooling instead.
