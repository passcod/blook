## Pitch

A simple certificate tool.

Mostly just binding to OpenSSL and creating/inspecting certificates with the least user interaction
possible. There are other tools that take a similar approach but they either do too little (only
self-signed certs, no self-CA-signed ones) or too much (install themselves by default into various
system certificate stores). Plus it was an interesting way to learn more about the OpenSSL APIs and
certificates.
