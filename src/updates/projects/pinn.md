## Pitch

A browser extension companion to track and manage the fanfic I read.

The idea so far is to track both what I want to read, what Iâ€™m reading, following, etc, all with a
minimal amount of interactions. Simply visiting a fanfic page should track it, and some work with
the Intersection Observer API should yield a pretty accurate detection of actively reading a fic vs
just having it open or looking through it without really reading.

## Outcome

Would still like to do it but it is heavily deprioritised.
