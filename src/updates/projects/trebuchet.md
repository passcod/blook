# Trebuchet

> March to October 2019

## Pitch

A deploy tool / experiment using Btrfs volume archives.

The actual deploy tool is a client/server/agent suite with some neat features but aiming to be
extremely light on resources, at least compared to many other tools Iâ€™ve tried.

But the core underpinning, the main idea, comes from playing around with btrfs volumes/snapshots and
the export/import commands on the tool. Essentially you can ask for an export of a volume, and you
can ask for an export of a volume *based on another volume*, then on import, which can be on a
completely different filesystem/disk/machine, as long as you have that same base volume, you can
restore.

So you can have filesystem-level diff archives on demand, with no awareness from the application
being built/deployed, and everything is already in standard linux tools.

It "just" needs some wrapping and managing.

## Outcome

The btrfs stuff added too many constraints; abandoned.
