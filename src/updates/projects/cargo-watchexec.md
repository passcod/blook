# Watchexec family

> Since August 2014

## Pitch

The watchexec family of Rust crates:
- Watchexec the library, to build programs that (by and large) execute commands in response to filesystem events.
- Watchexec the CLI tool, a general purpose tool which does this.
- Cargo Watch CLI tool, a Cargo extension which does this for Rust projects (now defunct).
- ClearScreen, a library for clearing the terminal screen (which is not as simple as youâ€™d think).
- Process Wrap, a library to launch programs in a process group (unix) or under job control (windows).
