# Armstrong

> November 2018 to early 2020

## Pitch

A job system for a wonderful world.

This was about building a job system that offers rich workflow potential and excellent
monitoring/auditability while also being very lightweight. Scalability and partition-tolerance are
secondary concerns at the moment. Inspired by Gearman, but aiming to be a superset.
