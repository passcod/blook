# Japanese

> August 2021 to 2024

## Pitch

Learning Japanese.

Against my prior try [learning Irish](irish.md), here I'm looking to a language where I have several
friends who speak it, a lot of the media I consume is in Japanese (at the source, anyway), and I do
have a little vocabulary from said media and cultural influences.

## Outcome

Still working at learning Kanji very slowly, but not really my focus.
