# What

## Pitch

A small tool to show off what I’m working on.

It’s a Node script that creates a small static site from a TOML file. On push of its git repo, a
Travis build kicks off, and pushes the result to its `gh_pages` branch, which updates the site.

## Outcome

Did its job, but the format was a bit annoying. In the end, I stopped updating it, and eventually
migrated all of it here, in the section you're reading this in.
