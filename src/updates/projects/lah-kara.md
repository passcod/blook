## Pitch

A RISC-V mini-ITX immersion-cooled Linux workstation.

### Compute

- [SiFive Unmatched](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unmatched): 4+1 RISC-V cores at 1.5GHz,
  16GB RAM, in Mini-ITX form factor.
- Intel AX-200 Wifi 6 / Bluetooth 5 adapter.
- 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD. I've got a double-sided high performance one from a previous build, and if it's
  not compatible I'll get something like a Samsung 970 Evo.
- RX 570 or 580 graphics, whatever I find. The goal here is not high perfomance (not a gaming rig),
  but something that can handle a few screens and only need a PCIe Gen 3 interface.

### Cooling

- Wide-gap slant-fin heat sinks to replace the OEM fin array (PCIe chip) and fan (CPU).
- Extension cabling for USB and Ethernet.
- I'm undecided whether I'll strip the fans off the graphics card and attempt to immerse it, or if
  I'll get a riser/extension to bring it outside.

#### Immersion fluid (oil)

Requirements:

- Boiling and smoke points above 120C
- Liquid at room temperature
- Long shelf life (doesn't go rancid quickly)

Nice to haves:

- Fairly clear or transparent (for aesthetics)
- Edible / non-toxic
- Doesn't stink!

The "long shelf life" requirement basically reduces the possibility set to:

- Mineral oil (petroleum, colorless, odorless, non-edible, but not touch-toxic, quite cheap)
- [Ben oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_oil) (golden, edible, fairly soft smell, 200C smoke
  point, very expensive)

So as much as I'd love having a veggie oil computer I'll probably go with mineral.

### Case

I'm thinking of making a custom 5-sides acrylic, 1-side aluminium box that would be the size of a
classic mini-ITX case. The aluminium side would be the thermal interface, and it would be sealed to
make it portable and safe from spills (not permanently glued, with a rubber seal or something), so
it can sit on the topside of the desk looking all cool!

### Naming

I name all my devices in a Star Wars theme. Workstations (desktop, laptops) after minor characters,
phones and tablets after vehicles, and IoT / utility devices (vacuum, printer, routers, various SBC
things, etc) after droids. My wifi network is named after a star system. I'm a nerd, sue me.
