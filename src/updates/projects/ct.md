## Pitch

`ls` and `cat` in one tool.

It uses `exa` to provide `ls`-like functionality, and if it's passed a file it prints it out instead,
so itâ€™s both `cat` and `ls` in a single two-letter tool, which makes it more convenient when
exploring a filesystem, instead of having to edit the head of the line to swap tool.
