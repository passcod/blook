Your cat, your glasses, and a giant butterfly walk into a room. You realise
you’re the bartender. They ask for coffee. “With almond milk”, the cat adds.
“You don’t want the aftermath of cow milk on your tile.” You turn around, sight
a half-empty bottle of vodka and loose tea leaves. It does not appear to be a
nightmare. Roll 3d17s mod 8, no, not those ones, the blue and yellow-polka-dots
ones, for your blood-alcohol level in ppm. You have 9¾ moves left before full
fatigue hits. All other members of your party are Permanently Vanished.
Consider the GM (that’s me) to be omnipotent (when sober) and having a fondness
for chocolates (white). As a reminder, you have Steel Skin Level 9 applied, a
full Spell Book, and Magic Points to last you until Armageddon comes… which
should be in 25 minutes, give or take a couple dozen seconds, according to
today’s schedule. Proceed.
