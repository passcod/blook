# Short Prose

I used to write shorts, in the same vein as my poetry. I haven't in some time.

A lot of this is "cringey young adult bullshit," perhaps, but I'm still fond of
some of it. However, a bunch of it is extremely dark.

Contents, with warnings when applicable:

- [The Box](the-box.md)
- [A Man](a-man.md)
- [ali.vei.nth.eni.ght](alive-in-the-night.md)
- [Regulus](regulus.md)
- [My mountain of Knowledge](my-mountain-of-knowledge.md)
- [Finally, I knew](finally-i-knew.md)
