Hold steadfast, friend

Hold

against hordes  
against the very wind  
　　　　rolling off mountain peaks  
against the rain  
　　　　the storm  
　　　　thunder  
against me and you  
against the world  
against all

Hold, friend, hold

onto the sunshine  
　　　　bright in the valley  
onto the morning after  
　　　　the evening before  
　　　　the night during  
onto me and you  
onto your wits  
onto your life

Hold, friend, hold

me right here  
you right there  
they over there  
and all further away

Hold, friend, hold

your breath  
your words  
　　　　thoughts  
　　　　tongue  
your sleepless nights  
your presence  
your being  
your self

Hold, friend, hold

don't forget  
　　　　love  
　　　　hate  
　　　　pain  
　　　　joy  
　　　　the things you find important  
　　　　the people  
to smile  
to cry  
to live

Hold steadfast  
　　　　friend  
　　　　in this world  
hold.
