# Sorry

> 24 February 2015

I just  
wanted

It seems hopeless. It seems like the world’s an ugly place.
Ever since you told me, ever since I knew, ever since we lived.

wanted to  
make you  
smile

Do you remember the beach? The sand, the trees, the water, salty
in our wounds. It stung, but it cleansed. Do you remember the night?
The moon, the stars, the glow, faces smiling through it all.
We were never tired, getting to sleep thinking we’d wake early and
continue, instead missing breakfast by hours. It didn’t bother us.

smile over  
pieces of  
my soul

I want to go to the moon and back. Visit all the moons in this system;
go beyond; go far. Pick and place a single pinch of moon-dust from each in
little glass boxes, meet up anew one day, you’ll barely grasp a faded memory
of me, and gift you the whole set just so that, maybe, with a bit of luck,
you’ll remember this from

my soul  
that I  
lost

a long time ago.
