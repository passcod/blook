Are you, are you  
Coming up with me  
They say they will be  
They say up, will we be  
Brave enough, brave to follow  
To leave, to flee, to go  
If we split, to leave me  
To mine and only  
Fate.

--------------------------------------------------

When the proponents of tyranny  
come to us and ask forgiveness:  
"I'm sorry."  
"I didn't know it would get so bad."  
We will tell them: "Too late.  
Too little. The toll has already rung."

We will not forgive.  
We will not forget.  
We will weep for the fallen.  
We will endure.

--------------------------------------------------

What am I supposed to say  
to young people coming to me  
wanting to leave this sad world  
because at least now  
it would be on their terms?

--------------------------------------------------

They are at our doors.  
They are our neighbours.  
They are our family.  
They are taking us.  
They are not returning us.  
They are denying us.  
They are ignoring us.

I don't know which hurts more:  
their blows, their betrayal,  
their torture, their murder,

or their indifference.

--------------------------------------------------

Are we out of sight?  
Are we out of night?

Our world has already tumbled  
Our life, for years now, has bled

Burn our secrets  
Burn our hearts  
Burn our love

--------------------------------------------------

Seal your lips forever, little one  
Or forget you ever were different.  
Rejoin your friends, embrace their joy,  
bury your truth deep inside yourself.  
Learn to smile again,  
learn to smile the scars away,  
forget yourself little one,  
at least you'll live another day.

--------------------------------------------------

It's the end of the line  
It's the end of our time  
It's the very last step.

Too tired, too broken  
we have stopped running.

Our final wish:  
to go soaring into the skies  
to fade away into the night

Our blood running free  
A red sunset  
A tide coming out  
My soul drying out.

--------------------------------------------------

(...)

--------------------------------------------------

You told us to run  
You told us to be free  
You kept our secrets  
You were broken for us  
Still you did not speak

We thank you  
We thank you  
We thank you all

We will remember you  
We've built monuments  
We're telling stories

At long last, with tyranny defeated  
We stand here honouring you  
Who made it all possible  
But didn't get to see the end

We weep for the fallen  
We run into the sky  
We smile true to our soul  
We remember who we are  
We restore our hearts  
We return to ourselves  
We heal the scars  
We dream at night  
We weep for the fallen

The toll has rung one final time.
