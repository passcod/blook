# Self

> 6 June 2016

Selflove, selfhate, selfwhatever  
I am a professional selfhater  
I do, every day, my regulation 24 hours  
And some more, for my own pleasures  
Every day, a little more, without fail.

Selflove, selfhate, what does it fucking matter  
I am a professional selfhater  
Every morning, every evening  
Every afternoon, and from nine to noon  
It’s my life, my death perhaps, it’s my very own tale.

In the association of professional selfhaters  
Selflove, selfhate, all together, all betters  
All infinite shades of black and white  
Shining down; a rainbow of moonlight  
Every day, every night, every one, every all.

Until one day perhaps — it’s the dream — none at all.
