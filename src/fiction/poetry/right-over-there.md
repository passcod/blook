# Right over there

> 26 January 2015

I am in the great unknown.

Slowly flying away  
from nowhere to be seen  
to where the wind will carry me.

Happy,  
I think.

There is a bird beside me. It  
sings softly, as softly as a bird  
can, a melody I'll forget soon.

I am in the great unknown.

You'll get there too,  
one day,  
whoever you are.
