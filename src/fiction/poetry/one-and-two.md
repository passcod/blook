# one and two

> 8 August 2013

tragically  
once upon a time  
two people  
far away  

one is missed  
two is missed  

forbidden  
hidden away  
in the dark  

two sets of  
three small words  
repeated  
over and over  
to oneself  

thinking of  
the other  
thinking of  
the one  
thinking of  

the heart  
the skin  
the eyes  
the face  
the hands  
the pain  

of one  
and two  
not being together  

still  

in the dark  
repeating  
"I miss you"  
"I love you"  
forever  

until  

one and two  
are together again.
