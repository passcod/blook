# No-effort Dairy Cream

Makes 6 portions.

## Ingredients

- 1L milk
- 65g maïzena (fine corn flour)
- 150g sugar
- Optionally, 50g to 200g liquid cream, as you want
- Flavour. E.g.:
  - Coffee in some soluble form
  - Spices: vanilla, cinnamon, clove, or to taste
  - Orange blossom water
  - 30ml amaretto, advocaat, coffee liqueur

## Method

1. Place __milk__, __maïzena__, __sugar__, and __vanilla__ in Thermomix, set to __90℃__,
    __18 minutes__, __speed 4__.

2. After __10 minutes__, reduce speed to __2__. No need to set a timer (unless you want to): you’ll
    hear the noise change as the texture shifts!

3. Add the __flavour__, optional __liquid cream__, and give it a whirl at __speed 3__ for
    *at least 30 seconds*.

4. Leave it running while you prep your ramekins or bolinettes, then pour.

5. Clean your thermomix immediately (better now than later, trust me).

6. Once your creams have cooled down enough, fridge all but one. Eat that one warm. You know you
    want to.

After two hours they’ll be good eatingstuff, for you or yours!
