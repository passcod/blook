# Blue Orange cocktail

1. **Ice a glass.**
   Use large ice cubes if you have some; the ice is not consumed here, it's used to cool the drink and keep it ice-cold while it's drunk.

2. **Half a teaspoon of salt.**
   I prefer coarse salt, or possibly fleur de sel if I have some to spare.

3. **One teaspoon of granulated sugar.**
   Simple syrup can also work.

4. **Half a shot lime juice.**

5. **One shot Cointreau.**
   I say one shot because it's fairly easy to remember and make with a standard jigger but really the drink benefits from a bit less Cointreu, so you can do instead:
   **half a shot Cointreau and a quarter shot overproof rum agricole**.

6. **Half a shot orange blossom water.**
   Again this is the "easy" measure, but it should be a bit less than the lime to not be overpowering.

7. **Top with soda water.**
   Or still, as one likes.

8. **Stir once.**
   You want to lightly distribute the flavours but not homogenise.

9. **Garnish with violet flowers.**
   Or mint, that works too.

Drink from the top down (no straws).
If you use a straw you'll get the salt immediately, but you don't want that until the end, as the cocktail's final note.
