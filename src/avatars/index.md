# Avatars

Here is an archive of the avatars I have used. Since 2015, I commission my
avatars from artists with a very loose mandate, letting them do whatever
they want within as few parameters as I need. Generally, no detail beyond
sizing was requested, although the exact brief varied for each artist.

All are copyrighted. Do not reuse.

and received in <time datetime="2018-W03">January&nbsp;2018</time>.

This was an experiment in commissioning larger pieces and selecting a crop
myself for the avatar itself. While I'm pleased with the results, I'm not
sure whether I'll continue with this format going forwards. You can see the
larger artwork by clicking on the avatar image.

## Close-up of me

From <time datetime="2011-W30">mid-2011</time> onwards, I used an extreme close-up of

accounts I haven't bothered cleaning up.

## Blue screen of code

Around <time datetime="2009-W15">2009</time> and onwards (I wasn't on the internet much
at that time), I used this as an avatar. I probably lifted it from Google Images.
