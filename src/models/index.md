# 3D Models

I have an [Ender 6](https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-6-3d-printer) 3D printer.
Here are some models I have designed and printed with it:

- [Mijia Hang](./mijia-hang/): a little outdoor housing for a Mijia Thermometer.
- [Filabox](./filabox/): a compact case for a filament reel.
