# Filabox

_Unfinished design: doesn't work / too tight / too slow_

- Material: PLA
- Print time: ~20 hours
- Raft/supports: no

This is a two-piece, two-prints case for filament reels. The idea is to have
circular boxes which themselves can behave as reels (they can be set on a
spindle), and which contain the actual reel. A small hole with a seal limits
the air/humidity intake while allowing the filament to unspool, a space for
dessicant helps keep the inside dry.
