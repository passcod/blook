# Wall plant pot

- Material: PLA
- Printer: Bambu A1 mini
- Print time: 8 hours
- Raft/supports: no

This is a two-piece plant pot for herbs that can be set on a surface or hung
from two screws into a fence or wall. The bottom part is a water reservoir with
overflow holes, and the top part is where the dirt and plant goes. It has drain
holes that are sufficiently large to allow roots to reach through; so these can
be watered both from above and below.

The square shape means plants can be rotated along cardinals to change
orientation e.g. for sun. The pot is small enough to be grasped in one hand to
lift it, and strong enough to resist a few falls from storms.

Designed in [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad) (master branch,
since the last "release" as of writing was in 2021, even though it's been in
active development all along... [release a few betas or something
ffs](https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/3640)), with the [BOSL2
library](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2).
