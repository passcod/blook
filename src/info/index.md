- Pronouns
  - in English: I've long described myself as "pronoun-agnostic" (which is a
    bit of an abuse of the term "agnostic"), which most people know as "any
    pronouns." While that's still true, in practice I _prefer_ `they/them` and
    also respond to `he/him`. `She`/`xem`/`peh`/`hie`/`zir` etc are fine if you
    want to for some reason.

  - in French and other gendered languages: in the absence of good consensus
    for gender-neutral language, I prefer masculine forms along with the
    pronoun `iel`, or `il` as fallback.

  - in MƒÅori: that's easy. Use `ia`!
