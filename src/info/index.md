- Pronouns
  - in English: I've long described myself as "pronoun-agnostic" (which is a
    bit of an abuse of the term "agnostic"), which most people know as "any
    pronouns." While that's still true, in practice I _prefer_ `they/them` and
    also respond to `he/him`. `She`/`xem`/`peh`/`hie`/`zir` etc are fine if you
    want to for some reason.

  - in French and other gendered languages or languages with only an impersonal
    neuter: in the absence of good consensus for gender-neutral language, I
    prefer masculine forms. If there is a well-accepted neutral neo-pronoun I
    prefer its use alongside masculine forms. E.g. `iel` in French, with `il`
    as fallback, but `αυτός`/`αυτοί` in Greek rather than `τό`.

  - in Māori and other languages with (or with _only_) a personal neuter: that's
    easy. Use it! (For example: `ia` (Te Reo), `O` (Turkish), `em` (PNG), etc…
