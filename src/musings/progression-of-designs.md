# A progression of designs

> Late 2022 - Early 2023


## Preliminary design

- Early feasibility estimation: is this even worth pursuing?
- What needs to be looked at to build confidence?
- Not about making plans, more about seeding ideas
- Must include a business case or a draft of one

**Hypothetical**: here's a direction we could go in, what do you think?


## Investigative design

Something we want to do but we don't know how yet

- Scope and refine the problem, output: a problem statement
- Cast about the solution space, pick a few ideas
- Investigate and evaluate them, present tradeoffs, rank

**Conjectural**: here's how we can go about it, let's pick one to deepen


## Design meeting (optional)

We know what we want, we have options, but we want to build confidence and consensus and query direction from a leader or from the group

- Group activity
- Bounce ideas around, refine solutions
- Challenge the problem
- As an offshoot of an investigation: present tradeoffs, talk through solutions

Output: a **consensus** on the direction to take


## In-depth design

We know what we want, where we're going, we want to know how exactly

- Hammer down the scope of both problem and solution
- Break down into areas and build up a unified, cohesive solution
- Should produce a spec or near-spec document and workplan

**Theoretical**: should not write code except to figure out details of the plan, but there shouldn't be any questions left at the end that aren't a lookup and some dev work away


## Implementation

Completes the metaphor: **Realisation**
