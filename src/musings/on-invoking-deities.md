# On Invoking Deities

I hold a particular belief that I… don't really talk about because I also have a deep loathing
for all forms of proselytising (the concept of "software evangelism" makes me uncomfortable, and
especially so when that is a titled position at a company someone can be hired for. Ick.).

It is that non-consensually invoking deities is, at best, rude.

Specifically:

- Invoking one’s own deity, or a spiritual presence one worships or follows, is an invitation for
  that being to take notice of you, and of your surroundings. Doing so in the presence and to the
  face of someone who is _not_ expecting that kind of attention is at best rude, if that person
  also happens to follow your same set of beliefs. If that person is following a _different_ one
  it's even more distasteful, at best.

- Invoking someone else’s deity or spiritual etc when you do not subscribe to them yourself is
  also rude and potentially an affront.

- Asking for a blessing from your patron spirits onto someone who has not consented to being brought
  to the attention of said spirit could well be considered an indirect attack. Asking for a blessing
  from deities you don’t even subscribe to is just plain weird to do directly, though soliciting
  attention from ones _via_ people who _are_ is acceptable (so long as they consent to).

Yes, this all applies even though I am an atheist. One could think that as an atheist I wouldn't
care about "imaginary beings taking imaginary attention to me," but I suppose I am very slightly on
the agnostic side for that: in the optic that "we can't be sure," I would say it would be _prudent_
to not randomly invoke gods and goddesses for no fucking reason.

Anyway, that is to say, I understand it is a very ingrained _tic_ in the English language to do so
all the bloody time, but if you can at all refrain, please do _not_ say "oh my ---" at me.
Especially if you don’t actually have religious beliefs, that just feels super weird to me. Why.

Less controversial perhaps, saying "--- bless you" is also off. Saying _just_ "bless you" is…
marginally okay, only in that it can probably be "I bless you" or something, like you’re bestowing
the blessing, you’re not invoking some extra-universal entity to pull on the fabric of spacetime
to arrange things my way. If you want to be all proper about it you could ask for permission; it’s
not something very done in these times, but it could stand to make a comeback.

Yes, your religion's dictate to preach at everything that moves is extremely fucking creepy, even if
you phrase all your preaching as "look at what my deity did for me" or "how good is my god, hallowed
be his name." The _intent_ is to "spread the good word" on the people who have, frankly, not asked
for any of your shite.
