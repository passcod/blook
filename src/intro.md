# Introduction

My name is Félix Saparelli. I'm a software engineer from New Zealand.

This website is in the shape of a [(md)book](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)! It's both a blog,
an archive, a list of projects, and various information about and around me. Have a look :)

## Selected Works

- **[Watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)** — A library to build tools to watch files and run commands
- **[Cargo Watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch)** — A watcher for Cargo projects (defunct)
- **[what are you even doing](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2041813)** — A collection of standalone short fanfics
