# Reading archive

Starting from 2017 I kept track of the large amounts of fanfiction I read, and
occasionnally original fiction, non-fiction, comics, BD, etc.

For fanfiction, I also kept track of the words (for ongoing works, "at time of
writing", marked "atow" in the listings), aka the length of the work, mostly
because it was trivial to do so. It's much less trivial for other form factors,
so I didn't keep track.

Historically, these reading archives were part of "monthly updates," but during
the last migration of this website, I split all of it out. See the [Progress
Updates](../updates/index.md) section for the rest of it.
