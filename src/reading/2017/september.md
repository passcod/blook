 - {SW} **[Lead Me From Fear To Love](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7394932)**.

   This is an excellent fic, if very graphic given its premise and content.
   There is little that I dislike about it: most of that is the lack of
   proofreading consistent throughout. It’s not badly written, but there’s words
   missing, awkward wording, common typos, etc. The story is well-organised into
   arcs and subarcs and side-stories, with very good blending and threading so
   while you can see the different arcs, they don’t feel disjointed at all. The
   principles that the Jedi are orienting themselves towards is also a great
   boon to me, as it is exactly the kind of thing one group in my Dawnverse is
   going for, so it’s giving me both confirmation and ideas on how to write it.
   Heartily recommend, albeit with warnings for very graphic violence and abuse.

   I'm running out of nice things to say about fics. Assume the details: it's a
   great fic, well-written, good arcs, awesome concept, etc. What I found really
   interesting about it is the point of view of people under an authoritarian
   regime. There's not much by people who enjoy serving under it, and not much
   by people who resist, although there's a bit of both. No, what's there most
   is people who believe they're doing the right thing, for very good reasons,
   who are _loyal_ to the regime, when they really really shouldn't be. There's
   people destroying themselves to survive, at any cost. It's a story about
   shades of people operating in a shady world where no circumstance, no
   decision, is ever black and white, right or wrong, wholly good or wholly
   evil. It's a convincing and chilling perspective, especially here, today.

   There are many good fanfictions, and many good books, but there are few great
   ones. This is one of them. Like many, it was written over a long time,
   refined and cultivated. It marries story, originality, and emotion in one big
   happy polyamorous family, and the climaxes are exhalting if terribly shaking.
   And of course, nothing is a coincidence, and everything is fucking poetry. A
   delight. {117k words}
