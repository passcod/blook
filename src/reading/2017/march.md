## Fanfiction

All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I finished (for the moment!) my exploration of the Harry Potter
fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.

- {HP} **[The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/78/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House), followed by [The Hogwarts Six and the Darkest Wizard](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard)**.

  Has complex plots without being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
  foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they're used,
  without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
  time travel mechanisms I have ever read, over a year thrice folded on
  itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
  plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in some other fics I
  won't cite where characters make plans and schemas and diagrams but there's
  only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and explained. And
  even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn't depend entirely
  on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance planning, munchkinning,
  and other techniques all combine together in an explosive mix, with no less
  than three different plots going on at the same time… at any given time. And
  that's just the first book! The second book is ongoing, and I am loving it.

- {HP} [What's a Little Death between friends?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12101842/2/What-s-a-Little-Death-between-friends).

  This is brilliant. Also fun and humourous and just the right amount of
  flirty. Long chapters, lots of action: physical, verbal, and otherwise.
  There's a very hot dominant sex scene right at the start of the second
  chapter, preceded (at the end of the first) by a bunch of realistic in-public
  affection and… more. It's honestly refreshing, after decidedly adult fics
  that nevertheless ellide any actual action, and a wide corpus of fics that
  deal with more or less horny teenagers instead of mature (*cough* as if
  *cough*) young adults. Ongoing. {60k words atow}

- {HP/SW Canon} **[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For)**.

  I love the perspective into and out of all the characters, especially Ahsoka
  and Aayla. The analysis and conflicting opinions of power structures with the
  Galaxy by an outsider that still has considerable experience that is more or
  less relatable, and by insider people both accepted and excluded from those
  same structures, yields interesting discussions packed with details. The "too
  many assumptions" thing resonated particularly with me, as it is something I
  struggle with when interacting with some people I know (they make assumptions
  that are often wrong or incomplete and draw concludions from that, without
  ever pausing to ask themselves or others about them, and end up making wild
  accusations that are hard to defend upon on the spot (and they then take that
  hesitation as admission of guilt, instead of confusion or trying to organise
  thoughts) as I need to think about what their assumptions could be that they
  end up there; the entire exercise is very frustrating). There are spectacular
  scenes of magic and action, the forces involved are of epic proportions, and
  yet humour both by characters and by story is pervasive. It's a good mix.
  Ongoing. {315k words atow}

- {HP} **[Behind Blue Eyes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes)**.

  It starts like any other teenager romance… well, the troubled ones anyway.
  Girl runs away from home, boy runs away from life, they meet and fall into
  friendship first, and then into love. But the likeness stops here. Because
  this is a Harry Potter story, and that means heartbreak, it means danger, it
  means terror, it means conflict and drama and emotions running high in all
  directions. It means magic, and all the problems that brings with it. It
  means love. And so _Behind Blue Eyes_ finishes like few other adult romances…
  with pain and loss and success and that particular kind of happiness that is
  like the flame of a phoenix: strong and bright, reborn many times, and
  fiercely everlasting. {440k words}

Also enjoyed, but no lengthy comment:

- {HP} [A Chance in Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5928118/1/A-Chance-in-Time). Well this was sweet. {200k words}
- {HP/X-Men} [Innocence Lost](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12321442/1/Innocence-Lost). Mmmm. Ongoing. {38k words}
- {HP/Marvel} [Invicible](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11779002/1/Invincible). A good start. Ongoing. {80k words}
- {HP} [Harry's Armada](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885587/1/Harry-s-Armada). {42k words}
- {HP} [Nobody told Me the rules](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10851278/1/Nobody-told-Me-the-rules). Unusually good for a crackfic, or unusually cracked for an adventure. {150k words}
- {HP} [Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power). An over-abundance of _Confringo_ variants. {410k words}
- {HP/SW} [The Havoc side of the Force](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force). Not sure if canon or legends, happens around the original six. Ongoing, followed. {150k words}
- {HP/SW} [Revenge of the Wizard](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard). Read the last author note! {172k words}
- {HP/SW} [Broken Chains](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains) and {HP/SW/Stargate} [The Stars Alone](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone). Interesting idea of the continuous universe: SW first, then HP millions of years later, in the same universe. Another story I just read had the same idea, but inverted. {156k + 128k atow}
- {SW/HP} [Harry Tano](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano). Fandom tag reversed as it's not a Harry-in-StarWars story like many others, but a Ahsoka-in-HP story. {136k words}
- {SW} [Free from Force](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11171261/1/Free-from-Force). {250k words}
- {SW} [The Protector](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3240441/1/The-Protector). A bit too happy and forgiving, perhaps. {116k words}
