## Fanfiction

I'm going on a strong Star Wars (all eras confounded) bender. I avoid Kylo/Rey
(extra ew) and Kylo/Hux fics because ew, and I like time travel fix-it fics.
Mostly I've been impressed at the depth and breadth of the verses crafted, and
the large currency held by Queer-abundant fics. It "makes sense" to have
genderqueer and varied sexualities in a universe where there's several dozen
_species_ cohabiting with each other, among a few _thousand_ worlds (sometimes
the scale of it all boggles the mind), but it's heartwarming every time.

I'll certainly be adding a bunch of references and homages to some of the best
fics out there into _my_ fic, mostly in passing-by references to names and
places. If you've been in the fanficdom, you should be able to pick out a few!

Something that's been interesting to notice is fics and authors that were
influenced by the Re-Entry fanfic epic. You see, in Canon (and Legends)
Coruscant has a 24-hour day. In the Re-Entry fanon, though, Coruscant has a
26-hour day. Well, in many non-Re-Entry fics that should AU from Canon or
Legends, and that state it as such, you get mentions of "25th hour" or "there
isn't more than 26 hours in the day" while in the Coruscanti Jedi Temple (or
elsewhere on planet)!

Exceptional fics within those I read this month:

- {SW Legends} **The entire [Re-Entry](https://archiveofourown.org/series/10129) and [Journey of the Whills](https://archiveofourown.org/series/11260) corpus**.

  An epic masterpiece.

- {SW} **[More Than Our Makers Intended](https://archiveofourown.org/series/392674)**.

  Excellent fic both in the romance/ship side and in the PTSD side. Notably,
  _actually gets_ that Rey comes from a desert-world where water is precious
  and food was scarce and she is used to work and also not used to have food be
  guaranteed. Similarly, that Finn was a trooper in an extremely harsh and
  conditioned army, where even trivial-for-bacta medical issues were more often
  than not resolved with blaster-aided disappearances. Also great at non-binary
  and queer genders and sexualities in a wider universe without making it be a
  super minor discreet story element (like some novels do, like they want to
  have it but also are afraid to bring it front and center). {26k + 26k + 4k
  words atow}

- {SW} [heart in a headlock](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8987779).

  Well-written, really, and has good emotions… I would have liked Rogue One to
  go more like this, I think. The depiction of Leia in this fic helped me
  re-evaluate a plot point that always bothered me in my fic, and that I'm
  going to change now. {53k words atow}

- {SW} [Back From the Future: Episode IV The Clone Wars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10129274).

  Has a fairly unique narrative style and form that I'm going to liberally
  borrow from, and not just because it seems tailor-made for my style and
  cadence of writing. I had been despairing of the glueing work I'd have to do
  to make my fic work, and the rewriting of scenes to comply with One
  Narrative, but this is much better. Story-wise, this is well done, both in
  plot that is organised and yet still surprising, in style which is "crack
  that takes itself seriously" and manages that perfectly, in humour both
  wordplay and plot irony and situational, in character development as well as
  characters stubbornly refusing to change, for good and bad. {107k words}

- {LotR} **[Sansûkh](https://archiveofourown.org/works/855528)**.

  Another incredible epic fanfic. I really like both the concept and the
  execution, and have healthy respect for the huge amounts of research and
  outright creation that must have gone into it. The character growth shown and
  told for everyone involved is first-rate. The use of Sindarin and Khuzdul is
  appropriate and not overbearing, which is very well done indeed. And the
  language style itself, that manner of speaking… I love that. (Also the
  massive amounts of recursive fanart displayed throughout is both heartening
  and frankly quite cute.) _AND DID I MENTION the vast diversity of cast!_
  Gay/bi are merely common, colour is varying and fine, neuro-atypicals are
  well-represented, and a/bi/trans-gender characters! That's right, with a
  plural! Not just two, either. Now _that_'s greatness. {518k words atow}
