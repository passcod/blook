## Comics

Found and binged [Wilde Life](http://www.wildelifecomic.com), about a kind?
lost? man running from his old life to a tiny town in Oklahoma... only to find
himself embroiled into the affairs of a typical teenager who's also a werewolf,
at least three witches, talking animals, asshole bears, and the odd ghost or
two. It's beautifully drawn, cute and amusing and seriously good.

## Fanfiction

Apparently I'm trying to read the entire Star Wars fanficdom on AO3. Or at
least, those that catch my eye in the listings. Still firmly avoiding certain
eww pairings. Briefly dipped into Thor fics as well. A lot of (delicious) NSFW.

 - {SW} **[Feathers of the Sand](https://archiveofourown.org/series/478750)**.

   One of the best fics I've read this month, perhaps even _the_ best. It is
   very much a rationalist fic, where not only the world is constructed in a
   rational manner, but the characters are shown to think and behave according
   to complex _reason_ rather than just whatever the author needed to happen at
   this point in time. (A work that does only the former is called a "rational"
   fic, which is too subtle a word difference I think.) Does enough original
   worldbuilding that it can get where it wants, without overwhelming the
   story, even though one can just _see_ the author could happily write an
   entire volume about their own part and culture of the world rather than
   stick to the Star Wars locations and stories. A+, would recommend. {15k +
