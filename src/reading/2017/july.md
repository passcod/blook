## Fanfiction

Works I recommend will now be **bolded**, and I've gone back to all other
Monthly Updates to highlight recommendations there, too.

 - {HP/Thor/Dr Who} [Of Wizards and Heroes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136).

   This was great! Perfectly suited to a fresh start in fanfic after three weeks
   not reading anything new. Humour and epic battle, with a last-minute third
   crossover adding yet another dimension to an already
   bendingly-parallel-worlds story. {94k words}

 - {HP} [Whispers in Corners](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255). {64k words}
 - {HP/Merlin} [Emrys Ascending](https://archiveofourown.org/works/932981). {111k words}
 - {HP/Thor} [Spellist](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507). {2k words}

 - {HP} [Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080).

   Not usually a genre of fanfic I read, but in some ways it works? A flurry of
   others like it below, before I went back to more class stuff. {14k words}

 - {HP} [no place like home](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786). {13k words}

 - {HP} [Stealing Harry](https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408).

   Good and sweet. _Very_ old fic, early 2000s according to the notes, but it
   survived this long, hmm? Some sequels below. {100k words}

 - {HP} [Russian Literature](https://archiveofourown.org/works/991387). {3k words}

 - {HP} [Laocoon's Children Year Two: Secret Tongues](https://archiveofourown.org/works/992558). {104k words}

 - {HP} **[Of a Linear Circle - Part I](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494) and [Part II](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11431794)**.

   That was delightful. While the disappearance of Harry isn't yet resolved, and
   honestly at this point feels a bit too much like a convenient way to get the
   main plot out of the way so we can explore Nizar's in peace, _I really don't
   mind_. Nizar — and the story — is sweet and quietly humourous. Heartily
   recommended. {107k + 23k words atow}

   Set in the Harry Potter verse, but ten years after Voldie's death, and set in
   America. Does not really mention Britain or Harry or any of them. Besides the
   story itself, which is excellent, the context of wizarding prejudices and
   house-elves within the wider context of America's deep history and current
   affairs with racism, corruption, police/authority violence and routine
   violation of the very laws they are supposed to defend, paints a chilling
   universe that left me uneasy throughout my read. On top of that, the quiet
   horror of schooling practices that reflects, no doubt, their non-magical
   counterparts in our reality only serves to reinforce the idea that there is
   something fundamentally _wrong_ with that country, and magic does not help.
   A recommended read, albeit with warnings. {166k + 235k + 204k + 262k words}
