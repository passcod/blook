## Fanfiction

As usual, only "good enough to be listed" newly-read fics are, well, listed, and
not everything I've read during the month. Especially recommended fics are in
**bold**.

 - {HP} [the family potter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861). {10k words}
 - {HP} **[There May Be Some Collateral Damage](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443)**. {61k words}

 - {HP} **[The Black Prince](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283)**. {139k words atow}

 - {HP} **[A Long Journey Home](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311)**.

   The premise is the most interesting I've read in a while, even in the already
   crowded genre of time travel, and even counting time travel closing-the-loop
   fics of the same order of magnitude on the time scale. Which, by the way,
   another very good fic which comes close to the premise and scale is one
   recommended last month, the _Of a Linear Circle_ series.

   However, _A Long Journey Home_ shines by its radically different
   story-telling, a sequence of extended vignettes in the long life of one
   Jasmine Potter, showing many stories and histories, each standing alone with
   grace and yet much richer for its part in the whole. The theories and
   explorations its characters go through, both personally and of magic, are
   rendered beautifully and yet without glamouring or wonderwashing, and without
   the praise-science-preach-science approach of ‘conventional’ rationalist
   fiction.

   And yes, this _is_ rationalist fiction, but embedded in great writing as an
   integral part of the work, instead of using the work as a mere transport.
