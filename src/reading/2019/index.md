# 2019: summary

## Fanfic

Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don't include fics I read but didn't like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow.

This year instead of updating in the mid month, I updated at the end of each
month, so the month’s total is really for _that month_, rather than staggered.
