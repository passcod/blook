# Febuary 2019

## Russian Doll

Yes, [the Netflix show](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627).

A short note, but I absolutely loved this.

## Fiction

So what I did this month is finish all my fics in instance, and then I went
through an entire collection and opened all fics that interested me in tabs, and
then spent the rest of the month working my way into “making my browser usable
again” which was kinda completely unnecessary but also I read some good fics!

   I kept thinking that the characters from this fic should meet the characters
   from Flamethrower’s Nizar Deslizare saga, because they have that same way of
   expressing themselves through scathe and scoff. They'd hit it off, I'm sure,
   after Nizar scolds them for being psychotic idiots.
