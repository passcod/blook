 - {HP} **[Rewritten in Time](https://archiveofourown.org/series/48618)**. One of the longest Harry Potter fics I've read, and one of the best _completed_ ones. I really really love this Draco. I also love the brand of humour, especially in the early books. It has lots of OCs, which can be offputting at first but works out well. A negative is that there are many many words that or not just badly spelt, but the wrong word altogether, only it _sounds like the right word_. My hypothesis is the author is slightly dyslexic, but who knows. That can cause some pause in the reading, but the reading is worth it. {585k words}
