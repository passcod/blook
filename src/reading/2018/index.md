# 2018: summary

## Fanfic

Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don't include fics I read but didn't like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn't include all
I read that _wasn't_ fanfic (yet, but I'm working on that for next year!).

After doing some sampling during the year, I have measured that I read about
120k words of fanfic _updates_ per _week_.

 - December 2017 → January 2018: 2,204k
 - January → February: 2,090k
 - February → March: 62k
 - March → April: 779k
 - April → May: 1,099k
 - May → June: 2,400k
 - June → July: 3,486k
 - July → August: 232k
 - August → September: 1,546k
 - September → October: 1,146k
 - October → November: 677k
 - November → December: 112k
 - Updates (estimated): 6,240k

(Total: 22 million words, down from 32 last year.)
