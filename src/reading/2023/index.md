 - {Marvel} [Of Home Near](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44230465). {26k words atow}
 - {SW} [Immutable, or, Five Times Obi-Wan Kenobi Compromised His Jedi Ethics for Anakin Skywalker](https://archiveofourown.org/works/324025). {2k words}
 - {HP} [A Second Chance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16237082). {3,599k words}
   At time of writing, this is the longest complete fic on AO3, of any fandom. I'd stopped reading
   new material in this fandom, but I couldn't resist the bragging rights, such as they are. Read in
   3 weeks between January and February. While I enjoyed it, even though I had to persist at times,
   I'm not marking it as recommended. Even with a happy ending, it's very dark, graphic, and oftimes
   gratuitous with its violence. It also has _way_ too many lemons (but at least they're good).
