   At time of writing, this is the longest complete fic on AO3, of any fandom. I'd stopped reading
   new material in this fandom, but I couldn't resist the bragging rights, such as they are. Read in
   3 weeks between January and February. While I enjoyed it, even though I had to persist at times,
   I'm not marking it as recommended. Even with a happy ending, it's very dark, graphic, and oftimes
   gratuitous with its violence. It also has _way_ too many lemons (but at least they're good).
