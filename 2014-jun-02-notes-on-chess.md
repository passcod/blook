As I'm participating in two tournaments at this moment, I have various
tidbits going through my head.

***

> I have decided to play three different styles:
  - In Wallyjack's games, I will play my usual style
  - In 27th games, playing as black, I will play fast
  - In 27th games, playing as white, I will play slow

***

> There seems to be a tendency for players to attack the king's weak side
> as an early game technique. It's frustrating (as it's painfully obvious),
> but it should be defended against nonetheless.

***

> Ooo, this one's a strange one: all our pawns intact, rooks and kings mirrored,
> and nothing else on the board. Play becomes tricky.

***

> Something quite annoying in tournaments is when players abandon all their games
> after having lost just one. It does give some easy victories, but it does so
> uniformly, which is quite frustrating because one *wants* the other players to
> be as swamped by the games as one is, and one *hopes* that some of these games
> might actually turn in the 'losing' player's favour. Then the balance of points
> may tilt, which is always good.
