        <h2>Why you’re blocked</h2>

        <p>I am a fairly prolific blocker on Twitter, and less of one on GitHub. I may also block people on other
          platforms, but I don’t really use other platforms as I do those two. For a time, it was possible to block
          some artists on Spotify, and I did that, too, but I believe that’s not really a thing anymore.</p>

        <h3>Current block reasons</h3>

        <h4>On Twitter</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I don’t like you.</li>
          <li>You’re an asshole to someone I like.</li>
          <li>You are or support or have voted for a white supremacist, fascist, or other people who are existential threats to me or my friends.</li>
          <li>You proselytise. Specifically religion, cults, parareligion, or cryptocoin.</li>
          <li>You’re a transphobe, a sexist, a homophobe of various stripes, an unrepentant racist, etc.</li>
          <li>You’re a troll. I don't mean shitposting.</li>
          <li>You’re such a “good” shitposter that you’re indistinguishable from a troll.</li>
          <li>You promoted a tweet I saw. There are exceptions if I genuinely liked the tweet.</li>
          <li>You are frequently engaged in bad-faith argumentating with people I follow.</li>
          <li>You had a viral tweet and posted those “sparkly lights” or whatever shitty promotion underneath.</li>
          <li>You’re a COVID, vaccine, climate change, etc denier.</li>
          <li>You’re a brand or mainstream american news site.</li>
          <li>You’re one of those services that “unroll” tweet threads. Please don’t use these.
            All they do is take people’s content and host it elsewhere, where the person has no control, and then they put their own
            ads on it, so they literally make money off people’s content without their consent. They also bypass blocks (i.e. someone
            I’ve blocked can read my tweets on a thread unroll website).</li>
          <li>You’re one of these services that provide a link to download videos off tweets. These are marginally better than the
            above, and some provide direct links which isn't so bad. However many do still rehost, bypass, and serve ads. I can’t
            tell the difference (and it might change later) so I block outright. Use a website that does that without using the
            reply-and-tag bots, that’s fine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>On GitHub</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You’ve especially pissed me off. Like, it takes a lot.</li>
          <li>You’ve been credibly accused or even actually convicted (!) of abusive behaviour.</li>
          <li>You support or work for certain companies which are <em>actively</em> engaged in fascist activities.</li>
          <li>You signed the 2021 RMS support letter, as of 30 March of that year.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Historical block reasons and block happenstance</h3>

        <h4>On Twitter</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You were on one of several third-party generated blocklists around 2015. These are the majority of wrongful blocks,
            as they were quite overzealous and of course the scale was very large.</li>
          <li>You followed some particularly nasty people in 2018-2019, when I ran some block scripts against their followers.</li>
          <li>You blocked me. I used to operate under a policy of mutual-blocking, that is, if I noticed you blocked me, I would
            block back. I’m not doing that anymore, and should have reversed all of these, but it’s possible I missed some.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>On Spotify</h4>
        <p>These would be current if blocking artists was still a thing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You’re an artist who is racist, homophobic, or unapologetically sexist.</li>
          <li>You’re an artist who financially supported Trump</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unblocking the wrongfully-blocked</h3>

        <p>…is something I’d love to do, but the difficulty is <em>identifying</em> who is really truly wrongly-blocked.
          For a sense of scale, at last accurate count in 2019, I had well over 150 000 blocks on Twitter. I would estimate
          having about 200 000 now. Reviewing a block is a forensic process, because as I’ll explain, you cannot just rely
          on metadata like who follows someone or their bio. Let’s have an extremely optimistic estimate of an average of
          two minutes per wrongful block, and ten seconds per rightful block. If <em>everyone I’ve blocked</em> should
          remain there, hand-reviewing the entire list to assure myself of that would take <strong>24 days of non-stop work</strong>.
          When I say non-stop, I mean it would take <strong>over 550 hours</strong>. If I have even <em>two percent</em> of
          wrongful blocks, that inflates to <strong>over 670 hours</strong>. It’s an enormous amount of work.</p>

        <p>But surely, I can automate a large part of it. Reader, I tried. Over several months. It turned out that my block list
          is extremely varied. Or rather, the people on it are varied. Or rather, the way the people on it present to me, the
          information I have available about them, is extremely varied. I don’t have much: I have their username, display name,
          bio, location and website fields, and maybe a few of their tweets if I write some scripts. I can put all that in a
          database, so I can process the large amounts of information all of this adds up to. And then what?</p>

        <p>There are some terms in bio I can outright block, right? Like <code>MAGA</code>. Right?
          <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/haaspolicy">Right?</a>
          <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/JoJoMorr1231">R</a>&nbsp;<a
             rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/e_whittler">i</a>&nbsp;<a
             rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/WestsideFireman">g</a>&nbsp;<a
             rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/littlebit_mia">h</a>&nbsp;<a
             rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/madumaga">t</a>?
          Well, fuck. (For the record, five links above contained text such as “I will block MAGA trolls”, and one is someone
          literally named Madumaga.) And I don’t even follow any of these people, this is just 30 seconds of searching. Okay,
          maybe exclude the ones that mention <code>MAGA</code> and <code>block</code>, or <code>MAGA</code> and <code>troll</code>,
          or some other combinations, surely that would work, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/KellyCreollady2">right</a>?
          <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/cat_conserva">Lol, fuck.</a>. Okay but surely someone who only has the word MAGA
          and not any of these other ones is a real one, right? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/KayaJade19">LMAO GTFOH</a>.
          (For the record, the first two are genuine MAGA people who block <em>anti</em>-MAGA “trolls” and the last one is a genuine
          person whose bio speaks, without using any of the obvious keywords, of them being previously banned due to harassment <em>by</em>
          MAGA people.)</p>

        <p>And this is a comparitively simple one. Try to do the same for transphobes, and it's a quagmire. But hold on, maybe I should
          do the inverse and identify people who are <em>clearly</em> not transphobes. Like, maybe someone who has pronouns in their bio
          and identifies as trans is fairly easy to search for? And surely <em>they</em> would be on the “unblock” candidate list?
          Boy oh boy. For one thing, truscums are a thing. For another, <strong><em>intersectionality</em></strong>.</p>

        <p>See, it's perfectly possible to have trans racists, gay sexists, lesbian transphobes, feminist anti-vaxxers.
          Assholes often have layers. But also, everyone can be an asshole. There is not a single group of people whose grouping
          attribute makes them free of the potential to be an asshole. Even if there was, there would be no reliable way to
          identify that group from their bio, or who they follow, or who they're followed by, or even scanning some of their
          tweets. Don’t believe me? Simple thought experiment: say there is such a marker. What is the first harasser who comes
          across it gonna do?</p>

        <h3>Forgiveness</h3>

        <p>And then there’s forgiveness. There’s a service run by fellow kiwi <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/tveastman">Tom Eastman</a>
          called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://secateur.app">Secateur</a> which lets you block people (and optionally all their followers,
          it's the “block script” I mention in one of the historical block reasons above) <em>temporarily</em>. The idea is this: people change.
          So blocking them now might be good, but they might see the error of their ways or listen to the right person or learn some <em>damn</em>
          empathy somehow, and now they’re not someone you want to block anymore, right?</p>

        <p>Maybe.</p>

        <p>There are three reasons why I don’t use it or something like it:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It’s another tool. I block a lot. I block quickly, I don’t take two minutes to think about it. I block on tweetdeck,
            I block on mobile. It’s never going to be a good fit for me to have to open a separate app, copy or type a username
            across, and hit go. That’s too much work. I just want to block and move on.</li>
          <li>I don’t think automated forgiveness is the way to go. <em>Because</em> of all the wrongly-blocked, I am also fairly fast
            at unblocking if someone who is blocked appears in a conversation with people I trust, and a browse of their tweets doesn’t
            bring up any red flags. The idea there is: if you’re block-worthy, surely I’ll block you again. So, if you’ve changed, and
            you intersect my life, chances are I’ll just unblock you outright. But if you haven’t, I don’t actually want the app to
            unblock you. And there’s no way for the app to tell.</li>
          <li>Blocking isn’t just for me. Blocking someone means they can’t see my tweets, and that includes replies to people, among
            other interactions. Blocking someone stops them interacting with me, but it also:
            <ul>
              <li>stops them interacting with others through me</li>
              <li>stops me accidentally retweeting one of their viral tweets later on</li>
              <li>helps protect people I interact with who <em>haven’t</em> blocked them</li>
              <li>protects people I interact with who <em>have</em>, or are private. Have you ever read a twitter conversation where one side
                is public and the other is a private account? You can still figure out a lot from one side, right? That’s what I’m talking about.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Maybe I should just unblock everyone, do a great big reset, and then restart my block list from nil, confident that <em>from now on</em>
          I’ll only block the deserving.</p>

        <p>I don’t think so. I believe that my block list truly makes my twitter experience better, and resetting it would make it materially worse.
          Maybe not immediately, but certainly in the longer term.</p>

        <p>Overall, the cold final part of it is that I believe that the cost is worth it. That whatever small percentage of people I have wrongly
          blocked is not significant enough to detract from the amount of good and comfort that having the rest rightfully blocked grants me.</p>

        <h3>Getting unblocked</h3>

        <p>I don’t think I’m sought after enough that this is thing, but, just in case.</p>

        <p>If we have a mutual in common, you can <em>maybe</em> try to go through them. If they’re okay with it. Don’t fucking harass my friends in
          trying to get unblocked from me, though, that’s only going to get you blocked <em>harder</em>. You can send me mail. You can contact me on
          other platforms. You have to be aware, though, that there’s a very high chance I’ll take any such actions extremely suspiciously, even as
          I outline them on here. Maybe if you really want to (for what reason? I’m not very interesting), and it’s a last resort.</p>

        <p>Specifically on Twitter: the <em>most likely</em> way to get unblocked is to just keep on having interesting conversations with my friends,
          and chances are I’ll happen upon them, see the block, figure it was a false-positive, and unblock you.</p>

        <p>Specifically on GitHub, if you’ve signed the RMS support letter: congratulations, the reason you figured out you were blocked is probably
          because you tried using one of my tools, like Cargo Watch, and realised signing a letter supporting an abuser has unintended consequences.
          Whoops. A good start is unsigning that letter. I’m also doing an amnesty program, where if you donate 100 USD or EUR to a <em>well-known</em>
          caritative organisation in support of sexual assault victims, and publish the proof publicly along with a denounciation of that fucking letter,
          and then email me that, I’ll unblock you. Unless you also qualify for a block under the other criteria, in which case, good try, fuck off.</p>
