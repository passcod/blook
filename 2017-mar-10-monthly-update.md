## NZ.js

As this is published, I am at [a JavaScript conference][NZ.js] in Wellington.

Now, as I write this, I have _no idea_, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to love
the talks and keynotes by [@aurynn], [@rockbot], [@riblah], and others.

## Ops School

I found this: http://www.opsschool.org/ and have started on it.

I don't think I want to pivot onto Sysadmin / Syseng roles, but I am always in
quest of knowledge to both make me more effective and combat my (waning,
thankfully) impostor syndrome.

## Master Kylo

Currently going through a second round of detailed outlining, after changing
the start point of the story and some perspective details, as well as a
deepening of the original style. I'm still aiming for at least a beta release
on Star Wars Day, but I may miss the mark.

## Blograph

The engine this blog runs on is a custom-built server designed and implemented
over three years ago when I tired at not having the options I needed, and just
decided to make it my way. However, I also didn't touch it much in those three
years. Over time, some bugs were discovered, a few missing features exposed,
and one large element of the design was never actually used — while creating a
performance limiter nonetheless.

Also, I needed an exercise to get back into Rust.

So I did a blackbox reimplementation of my blog, plus a few missing features,
minus two obsolete ones. The new version has upwards of 150 tests, sports a
**25x** performance boost, has up-to-spec CommonMark rendering and new footnote
support, and is a lot more _consciously designed_ instead of haphazardly put
together. It's live; you're reading this article on an instance right now.

**[Blograph]** is now also built deliberately to be possible for use by others.
It is still highly opinionated, and quite unsuitable for non-technical authors
— or for multiple authors, for that matter. But it can be used, if someone
finds it useful.

## Fanfiction

All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I finished (for the moment!) my exploration of the Harry Potter
fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.

- {HP} [The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/78/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House), followed by [The Hogwarts Six and the Darkest Wizard](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard).

  Has complex plots without being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
  foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they're used,
  without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
  time travel mechanisms I have ever read since HPMoR, and it probably
  surpasses that, even: used hundreds of times, over a year thrice folded on
  itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
  plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in HPMoR where we are
  told Dumbledore+Snape+Potter-Evans-Verres make plans and schemas and diagrams
  but there's only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and
  explained. And even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn't
  depend entirely on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance
  planning, munchkinning, and other techniques all combine together in an
  explosive mix, with no less than three different plots going on at the same
  time… at any given time. And that's just the first book! The second book is
  ongoing, and I am loving it. {274k + 131k words atow}

- {HP} [What's a Little Death between friends?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12101842/2/What-s-a-Little-Death-between-friends).

  This is brilliant. Also fun and humourous and just the right amount of
  flirty. Long chapters, lots of action: physical, verbal, and otherwise.
  There's a very hot dominant sex scene right at the start of the second
  chapter, preceded (at the end of the first) by a bunch of realistic in-public
  affection and… more. It's honestly refreshing, after decidedly adult fics
  that nevertheless ellide any actual action, and a wide corpus of fics that
  deal with more or less horny teenagers instead of mature (*cough* as if
  *cough*) young adults. Ongoing. {60k words atow}

- {HP/SW Canon} [I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For).

  I love the perspective into and out of all the characters, especially Ahsoka
  and Aayla. The analysis and conflicting opinions of power structures with the
  Galaxy by an outsider that still has considerable experience that is more or
  less relatable, and by insider people both accepted and excluded from those
  same structures, yields interesting discussions packed with details. The "too
  many assumptions" thing resonated particularly with me, as it is something I
  struggle with when interacting with some people I know (they make assumptions
  that are often wrong or incomplete and draw concludions from that, without
  ever pausing to ask themselves or others about them, and end up making wild
  accusations that are hard to defend upon on the spot (and they then take that
  hesitation as admission of guilt, instead of confusion or trying to organise
  thoughts) as I need to think about what their assumptions could be that they
  end up there; the entire exercise is very frustrating). There are spectacular
  scenes of magic and action, the forces involved are of epic proportions, and
  yet humour both by characters and by story is pervasive. It's a good mix.
  Ongoing. {315k words atow}

- {HP} [Behind Blue Eyes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes).

  It starts like any other teenager romance… well, the troubled ones anyway.
  Girl runs away from home, boy runs away from life, they meet and fall into
  friendship first, and then into love. But the likeness stops here. Because
  this is a Harry Potter story, and that means heartbreak, it means danger, it
  means terror, it means conflict and drama and emotions running high in all
  directions. It means magic, and all the problems that brings with it. It
  means love. And so _Behind Blue Eyes_ finishes like few other adult romances…
  with pain and loss and success and that particular kind of happiness that is
  like the flame of a phoenix: strong and bright, reborn many times, and
  fiercely everlasting. {440k words}
