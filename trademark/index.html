          <h1>passcod Trademark Policy</h1>

          <p>This policy describes the passcod trademark and how you may use it.
            For background on why I have a trademark on my pseudonym, refer to the
            <a href="">introductory blog post</a>.</p>

          <h2>What is passcod?</h2>

          <p>passcod is my pseudonym, used primarily on the internet but not only.
            It was created circa 2008. Personally, passcod has become a part of my
            <em>name</em> and carries its primary value from this.</p>

          <p>For the usage of this trademark, however, passcod is considered a
            <em>brand</em> over design, development, and distribution of software,
            as that is my main activity and where it is used and recognised most.</p>

          <h2>Nominative use — No need to type ™ on twitter</h2>

          <p>It's perfectly OK to use "passcod" to refer to me, to the software I
            produce, and to my development work. That's different from using "passcod"
            in the name of one or one's own product or service.</p>

          <p>Nominative use means it's OK to refer to something that is trademarked,
            but it is not OK to incorporate one's trademark into another's product,
            service, or name. That's why you would need permission from the trademark
            owner to open "Discount Nike Shoes" or "iPad App Marketplace".</p>

          <h2>The passcod trademark policy</h2>

          <p>I ask that you get my permission to use the passcod name as part of the
            name of any project, product, service, domain, or company.</p>

          <p>I will grant permission to use the passcod name for these situations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>When referring to me as a person.</li>
            <li>When referring to my works, designs, software, projects, products, or
              services, in the description but not the name of a project related to one
              or more of these works, except in a way that implies endorsement or
              misrepresents in any way the relationship between the project and mine.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I further reserve the right to retract permission at my discretion, at any time.</p>
